# Backend Development Checklist

## Architecture & Structure
- [ ] Hexagonal architecture layers properly separated (domain, application, infrastructure)
- [ ] Domain layer contains only business entities and rules
- [ ] Application layer manages use cases and orchestration
- [ ] Infrastructure layer handles external concerns (database, HTTP, messaging)
- [ ] Primary and secondary ports clearly defined
- [ ] Dependencies point inward toward domain core
- [ ] No circular dependencies between layers

## Domain-Driven Design
- [ ] Bounded contexts properly identified and separated
- [ ] Domain entities follow DDD patterns
- [ ] Value objects used for type safety and validation
- [ ] Aggregates maintain consistency boundaries

## Testing
