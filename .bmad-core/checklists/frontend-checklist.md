# Frontend Development Checklist

## Architecture & Structure
- [ ] Clean Architecture layers properly separated (domain, application, infrastructure, presentation)
- [ ] Domain layer contains only business entities and rules
- [ ] Application layer manages use cases and orchestration
- [ ] Infrastructure layer handles external concerns (API, storage, etc.)
- [ ] Presentation layer contains only UI components and pages
- [ ] No circular dependencies between layers
- [ ] Dependency inversion principle followed

## TypeScript & Code Quality
- [ ] Strict TypeScript configuration enabled
- [ ] All components have proper type definitions
- [ ] No usage of `any` type
- [ ] Props interfaces properly defined
- [ ] Custom hooks have proper typing
- [ ] API responses are properly typed
- [ ] State management stores have type safety

## Component Standards
- [ ] Components follow single responsibility principle
- [ ] Proper use of React.memo for performance
- [ ] Components are composable and reusable
- [ ] Props are properly documented with JSDoc
- [ ] Default props are defined where appropriate
- [ ] Components handle loading and error states

## State Management
- [ ] Zustand stores follow DDD patterns

## Performance
