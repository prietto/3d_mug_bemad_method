# Epic 1: Foundation & Core 3D Infrastructure

### Epic Goal
Establish essential project infrastructure including repository setup, development environment, basic CI/CD pipeline, and core 3D mug visualization capability. This epic delivers a deployable landing page with interactive 3D model that validates technical feasibility and provides foundation for all subsequent development work.

### Story 1.1: Project Foundation Setup
As a developer,  
I want a properly configured project repository with development environment,  
so that I can efficiently develop and deploy the application with consistent tooling and workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Monorepo structure created using Next.js 14+ with integrated frontend and API routes
2. Next.js application initialized with TypeScript, Supabase PostgreSQL connection, and API routes structure
3. React frontend initialized with TypeScript, Three.js dependencies, and Tailwind CSS
4. Shared types folder with common TypeScript interfaces for lead data and design preferences
5. Development environment configured with Supabase database configuration, ESLint/Prettier for code consistency
6. Testing infrastructure setup with Vitest and Testing Library for unit/integration testing
7. Basic CI/CD pipeline configured for automated testing and Vercel deployment
8. Third-party service setup: Vercel account configuration and Google Analytics integration
9. README documentation provides clear setup instructions for new developers

### Story 1.2: Landing Page Hero Section
As a potential customer,  
I want to immediately understand the value proposition and see professional design quality,  
so that I feel confident this business can deliver high-quality custom mugs.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Hero section displays compelling headline about 3D mug customization capabilities
2. Clear value proposition text explains interactive design experience and professional sublimation quality
3. Professional visual design with clean typography and appropriate color scheme
4. Call-to-action button prominently displayed directing users to 3D designer
5. Mobile-responsive layout maintains visual hierarchy and readability on all screen sizes
6. Basic navigation and footer with contact information and privacy policy links
7. Page loads completely within 3 seconds on standard broadband connections

### Story 1.3: Basic 3D Mug Model Display
As a potential customer,  
I want to see and interact with a realistic 3D mug model,  
so that I can visualize the quality and possibilities of custom mug creation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Three.js scene renders a realistic 3D mug model with appropriate lighting and materials
2. Users can rotate the mug by dragging (desktop) or swiping (mobile) with smooth motion
3. Pinch-to-zoom functionality works on mobile devices with appropriate zoom limits
4. 3D rendering maintains 30+ FPS performance on target devices
5. Model loads within 5 seconds and displays loading indicator during initialization
6. Basic camera controls allow users to view mug from multiple angles
7. 3D viewport is properly sized and positioned within the landing page layout

### Story 1.4: Mobile-Optimized 3D Controls
As a mobile user,  
I want intuitive touch controls for the 3D mug interaction,  
so that I can easily explore the model without frustration or performance issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Touch controls are responsive and intuitive for rotation, zoom, and pan gestures
2. Visual feedback indicates interactive areas and available gestures
3. 3D performance is optimized for mobile devices with graceful degradation on older hardware
4. Touch controls don't interfere with page scrolling or other mobile interactions
5. Control sensitivity is appropriate for thumb and finger navigation
6. Reset button allows users to return to default view angle and zoom level
7. 3D controls work consistently across iOS Safari, Chrome, and Android browsers

### Story 1.5: Basic API Routes and Database
As a system,  
I need foundational API endpoints and local database connectivity,  
so that lead capture and design storage can function reliably.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Next.js API routes structure created with health check endpoint (/api/health)  
2. Supabase PostgreSQL connection established with proper error handling and connection pooling
3. Basic lead and design data models defined with TypeScript interfaces and SQL schema
4. API endpoints created: POST /api/leads, POST /api/designs, GET /api/designs/:id
5. Environment configuration supports development and production environments (.env.local, .env.production)
6. Basic logging and error handling implemented for all API routes
7. API route documentation added to README with request/response examples
