# Epic List

**Epic 1: Foundation & Core 3D Infrastructure**
Establish project setup, core 3D visualization capability, and basic user interaction - delivering immediate technical proof-of-concept while building essential development foundation.

**Epic 2: Interactive Design Experience**
Enable full customization workflow with image uploads, color selection, and text addition - creating the engaging user experience that drives lead conversion.

**Epic 3: Lead Capture & Analytics Integration**
Implement lead generation functionality with database storage, form validation, and analytics tracking - completing the business value proposition and measurement capabilities.

**Epic 4: Single-Page Minimalist UX Transformation**
Refactor the multi-screen landing page into a unified single-page experience with split-screen layout, eliminating navigation friction and presenting the 3D tool and lead form simultaneously for improved conversion.

**Epic 5: 3D Rendering Troubleshooting & Component Refactor**
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete | **Priority:** Critical | **Dependencies:** Epic 1
Resolve critical rendering issues preventing 3D mug display and establish simplified component architecture for maintainable feature development. Addresses technical debt from initial implementation and creates foundation for incremental feature additions.

**Epic 6: 3D Visual Quality Improvements**
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete | **Priority:** Medium | **Dependencies:** Epic 5
Improve the visual quality and realism of the 3D mug customization experience by fixing geometry and texture rendering issues that create an unprofessional appearance. Eliminates visible gap between uploaded images and mug surface through radius correction.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Image texture sits flush against mug surface (no visible gap)
- Fixed image loader error for null/empty URLs
- Curved geometry radius matches mug cylinder (1.2)
- All existing controls continue working correctly

**Epic 7: 3D UX & Controls Enhancement**
**Status:** üìù Draft | **Priority:** High | **Dependencies:** Epic 6
Enhance the 3D mug customizer user experience by improving controls layout, image positioning capabilities, and maintaining visual context during customization. Addresses UX friction where canvas scrolls out of view and image scaling is limited to height only.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Image completely flush against mug surface (remaining gap eliminated)
- Image size control scales proportionally (width and height together)
- 2-column layout with sticky canvas (desktop)
- Responsive single-column layout (mobile)
- All controls remain functional with improved visual feedback
