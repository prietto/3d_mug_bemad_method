### Background Context

This PRD addresses the critical market entry challenge facing new ceramic mug customization businesses: the chicken-and-egg problem of needing customers to justify inventory investment while customers need quality examples before committing to orders. Traditional approaches require significant upfront investment in physical samples and rely on ineffective static photo galleries that fail to demonstrate customization possibilities.

Our solution leverages interactive 3D visualization technology to showcase unlimited customization possibilities without physical inventory investment. The landing page combines lead generation with an engaging Three.js-powered 3D mug designer that allows visitors to upload designs, customize colors, and see realistic renderings in real-time. This approach transforms uncertain browsers into qualified prospects by providing immediate visual confidence in the final product quality and capabilities.
