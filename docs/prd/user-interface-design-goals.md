# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The landing page should embody a premium, professional aesthetic that immediately conveys quality and trustworthiness while remaining approachable and fun. The design should eliminate friction between visitor arrival and 3D tool engagement, creating a natural flow that feels more like "playing with a cool tool" than "filling out a form." Visual hierarchy should guide users seamlessly from initial value proposition through 3D interaction to lead conversion, with each step feeling inevitable and delightful rather than pushy or sales-heavy.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Simultaneous Visibility:** Present both the 3D customization tool and lead capture form on a single screen from the start, allowing users to engage with either element based on their preference. This eliminates navigation friction and reduces cognitive load by making all functionality immediately accessible. The split-screen layout (desktop) and vertical stack (mobile) ensure both elements receive appropriate visual priority.

**Touch-First Mobile Experience:** All 3D interactions must work intuitively with finger gestures - pinch to zoom, drag to rotate, tap to select - with visual feedback that makes the digital experience feel as tactile as handling a physical mug.

**Immediate Visual Feedback:** Every user action should produce instant, satisfying visual changes to the 3D model, creating a sense of direct manipulation and creative control that builds confidence in the final product quality.

**Contextual Guidance:** Subtle visual cues and micro-animations guide users through the customization process without overwhelming them, using progressive disclosure to reveal advanced options only when needed.

### Core Screens and Views

**Single-Page Split-Screen Layout:** Unified page experience with minimal header (logo + tagline) followed by split-screen layout featuring:
- **Left/Top (Desktop/Mobile):** Interactive 3D mug customization tool with full controls for image upload, color selection, and text addition
- **Right/Bottom (Desktop/Mobile):** Always-visible lead capture form collecting contact information alongside real-time design preview

The layout eliminates navigation steps and presents all functionality simultaneously. Desktop uses 60/40 split favoring 3D viewer, mobile uses vertical stack with 3D positioned above form for optimal thumb reach and visual hierarchy.

**Mobile-Optimized Layout:** Vertical stack layout prioritizes 3D viewport above the fold, with lead form immediately accessible via scroll. Touch-friendly controls maintain 44px+ target sizes, and both components are fully functional without horizontal scrolling.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

All interactive elements must be keyboard navigable with clear focus indicators, color choices must meet WCAG AA contrast ratios, and alternative text must be provided for all images and 3D model states. The 3D tool should include keyboard shortcuts for rotation and zoom to accommodate users who cannot use touch or mouse gestures effectively.

### Branding

**Professional Sublimation Quality Aesthetic:** Visual design should convey precision, quality, and professional manufacturing capabilities while remaining warm and approachable. Clean typography, generous whitespace, and high-quality imagery that showcases sublimation printing capabilities without appearing sterile or industrial.

**Modern Web Technology Showcase:** The 3D visualization itself becomes a branding element, demonstrating technical sophistication and innovation that sets the business apart from traditional custom printing competitors using static catalogs or simple photo galleries.

**Trust and Credibility Signals:** Subtle design elements that build confidence - professional photography, clean layouts, clear contact information, testimonials or quality indicators - without overwhelming the primary 3D interaction experience.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**Mobile-First Progressive Enhancement:** Design starts with optimal mobile experience (iPhone/Android), then enhances for tablet and desktop viewports. 3D performance optimization prioritizes mobile devices while taking advantage of additional screen real estate and processing power on larger devices.

**Cross-Platform Consistency:** Unified experience across all device types with platform-appropriate interaction patterns (touch gestures on mobile, mouse controls on desktop) while maintaining consistent visual identity and user flow.

**Design Evolution Note (v2.0):** The initial multi-screen design with progressive engagement (Epic 1-3) was superseded by a strategic decision to adopt a single-page minimalist approach (Epic 4). This change reflects insights that simultaneous visibility of all functionality reduces friction more effectively than progressive disclosure for this specific use case.
