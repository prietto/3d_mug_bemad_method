# Epic 6: 3D Visual Quality Improvements - Brownfield Enhancement

**Status:** âœ… Complete | **Priority:** Medium | **Dependencies:** Epic 5

## Epic Goal

Improve the visual quality and realism of the 3D mug customization experience by fixing geometry and texture rendering issues that create an unprofessional appearance.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current relevant functionality:**
- 3D mug renderer using Three.js and React Three Fiber in `SimpleMugTest.tsx`
- Custom curved plane geometry for wrapping images and text around cylindrical mug surface
- Image upload and texture mapping with position/scale controls
- Text rendering with customizable size, color, and content

**Technology stack:**
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- React Three Fiber (@react-three/fiber)
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- TypeScript for type safety
- Custom BufferGeometry for curved surfaces

**Integration points:**
- `createCurvedPlaneGeometry()` function (shared by text and image rendering)
- Mug component with CylinderGeometry for mug body
- Image texture mapping via Three.js TextureLoader
- React state management for image scale and position controls

### Enhancement Details

**What's being added/changed:**
The current implementation has a visual quality issue where uploaded images appear to "float" above the mug surface with a visible gap. This is caused by a radius mismatch between the curved plane geometry (radius = 1.23) and the mug cylinder geometry (radiusTop = 1.2). The 0.03 unit gap creates an unrealistic appearance.

**Changes required:**
1. Parameterize the `createCurvedPlaneGeometry()` function to accept a configurable radius
2. Update image and text mesh instantiation to use the correct mug radius (1.2)
3. Optionally add fine-tuning controls for Z-position offset to prevent z-fighting
4. Ensure backward compatibility with existing text rendering functionality

**How it integrates:**
- Modifies existing shared geometry creation function
- Updates geometry instantiation in both image and text rendering paths
- Maintains all existing state management and user controls
- No changes to React component structure or props

**Success criteria:**
1. Image texture sits flush against mug surface with no visible gap
2. Curved geometry radius matches mug cylinder radius at the contact point
3. Image wraps smoothly following mug contour without distortion
4. All existing controls (image upload, size, position, text customization) continue working
5. Performance maintains 60 FPS target
6. No regression in existing mug rendering features

## Stories

### Story 6.1: Fix Image Texture Gap and Improve Curved Geometry

**Description:** Eliminate the visible gap between uploaded images and the mug surface by correcting the radius mismatch in the curved plane geometry function. This involves parameterizing the geometry creation function and ensuring both image and text rendering use the correct radius value that matches the mug cylinder.

**Key Tasks:**
- Modify `createCurvedPlaneGeometry()` to accept radius parameter with default value
- Update image mesh geometry creation to pass radius = 1.2 (matching mug top)
- Update text mesh geometry creation to pass radius = 1.2
- Add optional Z-offset for fine-tuning if z-fighting occurs
- Test all existing image and text controls for regression

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Image sits flush on mug surface (no gap)
2. Radius matches mug cylinder (1.2)
3. Smooth wrapping without distortion
4. Existing controls work correctly
5. Text rendering unaffected
6. 60 FPS maintained

### Story 6.2: Fix Image Loader Error with Empty URL (Hotfix)

**Description:** Fix runtime error that occurs when page loads without an uploaded image. The `useLoader` hook currently attempts to load an empty string URL when `imageUrl` is null, causing "Could not load : undefined" console errors and potential user experience issues. This hotfix implements conditional image loading with proper React Hooks compliance.

**Key Tasks:**
- Implement conditional image loading using Suspense boundary with separate ImageMesh component
- Test image upload/remove flow to ensure no regression
- Verify no console errors on initial page load without image
- Validate performance impact (maintain 60 FPS baseline)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Page loads successfully without runtime errors when no image is uploaded
2. Image loader does not attempt to load empty or null URLs
3. Image texture only loads when valid imageUrl is provided
4. Existing image upload and display functionality continues to work
5. Text rendering and mug display work correctly without uploaded image
6. No console errors related to image loading on initial page load

**Rationale for Inclusion in Epic 6:**
While this is a hotfix for a runtime error (not originally planned), it directly impacts the 3D visual quality user experience. Console errors degrade perceived quality and professionalism, aligning with Epic 6's goal of improving visual quality and realism.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (function signature uses default parameter)
- [x] Database changes are backward compatible (N/A - purely client-side rendering)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (no UI changes, only visual improvement)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (geometry creation logic unchanged)

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Changing the radius value could cause texture clipping through the mug surface if too small, or maintain the gap if too large. Additionally, modifying the shared geometry function could inadvertently break text rendering.

**Mitigation:**
1. Use mug's radiusTop value (1.2) as the starting point - matches geometry exactly
2. Add optional Z-offset parameter for fine-tuning surface distance without changing radius
3. Test both image and text rendering after changes
4. Use default parameter value to maintain backward compatibility
5. Consider `depthTest` and `renderOrder` properties to prevent z-fighting

**Rollback Plan:**
- Simple code revert: restore `createCurvedPlaneGeometry()` to original hardcoded radius = 1.23
- No database migrations or API changes to rollback
- Client-side only change means instant rollback via code deployment
- Git commit revert is sufficient for complete rollback

## Technical Context for Story Development

**File Locations:**
- Component: `app/components/SimpleMugTest.tsx`
- Geometry function: Lines 42-85
- Mug component: Lines 97-164
- Image rendering: Lines 151-161
- Text rendering: Lines 138-148

**Current Implementation Details:**
```typescript
// Current hardcoded radius (line 48)
const radius = 1.23

// Mug cylinder geometry (line 117)
<cylinderGeometry args={[1.2, 1.0, 2.5, 32]} />
// radiusTop = 1.2, radiusBottom = 1.0

// Gap calculation: 1.23 - 1.2 = 0.03 units
```

**Recommended Solution:**
```typescript
// Parameterized function signature
function createCurvedPlaneGeometry(
  width: number,
  height: number,
  curveSegments: number = 32,
  radius: number = 1.2  // Match mug radiusTop
)

// Updated geometry creation
const imageCurvedGeometry = useMemo(() => {
  return createCurvedPlaneGeometry(2, imageScale, 48, 1.2)
}, [imageScale])

const textCurvedGeometry = useMemo(() => {
  return createCurvedPlaneGeometry(2, 0.6 * textSize, 48, 1.2)
}, [textSize])
```
