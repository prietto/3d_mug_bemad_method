# Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The landing page shall display a hero section with clear value proposition, compelling headline about 3D mug customization, and prominent call-to-action button directing users to the 3D designer tool.

**FR2:** The system shall provide an interactive 3D mug model using Three.js/WebGL that allows users to rotate, zoom, and view the mug from multiple angles with smooth 30+ FPS performance.

**FR3:** Users shall be able to upload image files (PNG, JPG formats) via drag-and-drop or file selection interface, with images automatically applied to the 3D mug surface for real-time visualization.

**FR4:** The 3D designer shall include a color picker allowing users to select from 3-5 predefined mug base colors with immediate visual updates to the 3D model.

**FR5:** Users shall be able to add custom text to the mug with font selection (2-3 font options) and basic positioning/scaling controls within the 3D interface.

**FR6:** The system shall present an integrated lead capture form after users engage with the 3D tool, collecting name, email, phone, and project description with validation.

**FR7:** All lead information and associated design preferences shall be automatically stored in MongoDB database for sales follow-up and customer relationship management.

**FR8:** The entire application shall be fully responsive and functional on mobile devices with touch-optimized 3D controls and simplified interface for small screens.

**FR9:** The system shall integrate Google Analytics to track user behavior, 3D tool engagement metrics, and conversion rates from visitors to leads.

**FR10:** Users shall be able to reset their design and start over at any point during the customization process without losing application state.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** The 3D tool shall load and become interactive within 5 seconds on standard broadband connections to prevent user abandonment.

**NFR2:** The application shall maintain cross-browser compatibility with Chrome 90+, Safari 14+, Firefox 88+, and Edge 90+ on both desktop and mobile devices.

**NFR3:** The system shall handle mobile 4G connections gracefully with optimized 3D model loading and progressive image enhancement for slower networks.

**NFR4:** All uploaded images shall be validated for file type, size (max 5MB), and dimensions with appropriate error messaging for invalid uploads.

**NFR5:** The MongoDB database shall implement proper data validation, indexing for lead queries, and secure connection protocols for data protection.

**NFR6:** The application shall implement HTTPS enforcement, CORS configuration, and input sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities.

**NFR7:** The lead capture form shall comply with GDPR requirements including clear data usage consent and privacy policy links.

**NFR8:** The 3D rendering performance shall maintain consistent frame rates across target devices, with graceful degradation on older mobile hardware.

**NFR9:** The system architecture shall support horizontal scaling to handle traffic spikes during marketing campaigns without service disruption.

**NFR10:** All user interactions with the 3D tool shall be logged for analytics while maintaining user privacy and data minimization principles.
