# Epic 2: Interactive Design Experience

### Epic Goal
Transform the basic 3D visualization into a fully interactive design experience where users can upload images, customize colors, add text, and create personalized mug designs. This epic delivers the core value proposition that converts curious visitors into engaged prospects ready for lead capture.

### Story 2.1: Image Upload and Processing
As a potential customer,  
I want to upload my own image and see it applied to the 3D mug,  
so that I can visualize how my personal design will look on the final product.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Drag-and-drop interface allows users to easily upload PNG and JPG files up to 5MB
2. File selection button provides alternative upload method for users who prefer clicking
3. Image validation prevents invalid file types with clear error messaging
4. Uploaded images are automatically processed and optimized for 3D texture mapping
5. Images appear on the mug surface in real-time with proper scaling and positioning
6. Loading indicator shows processing status during image upload and application
7. Users can remove or replace uploaded images with simple controls

### Story 2.2: Mug Color Customization
As a potential customer,  
I want to change the base color of the mug to match my design preferences,  
so that I can see how different color combinations will look together.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Color picker displays 3-5 predefined mug base colors (white, black, blue, red, green)
2. Clicking/tapping a color immediately updates the 3D model with smooth transition animation
3. Color changes maintain uploaded image visibility and quality on the mug surface
4. Selected color is visually indicated in the color picker interface
5. Color changes work smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices
6. Default white color is preselected when users first access the designer
7. Color selection state is maintained when users navigate within the application

### Story 2.3: Text Addition and Customization
As a potential customer,  
I want to add custom text to my mug design with font and positioning options,  
so that I can create personalized messages or branding elements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Text input field allows users to enter custom text up to 50 characters
2. Font selector provides 2-3 font options (serif, sans-serif, decorative)
3. Text appears on the 3D mug surface in real-time as users type
4. Basic positioning controls allow users to move text up/down and left/right on mug surface
5. Text size can be adjusted with simple slider or +/- controls
6. Text color contrasts appropriately with selected mug base color
7. Users can delete text completely or reset to default positioning

### Story 2.4: Design Reset and Multiple Design Options
As a potential customer,  
I want to easily start over or try different design combinations,  
so that I can explore various options before deciding on my final design.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. "Reset Design" button clears all customizations and returns mug to default state
2. Reset confirmation prevents accidental loss of design work
3. Users can change images without losing color and text customizations
4. Individual elements (image, color, text) can be modified independently
5. Design state is maintained during normal page interactions and scrolling
6. Clear visual feedback indicates when changes have been applied successfully
7. Reset functionality works consistently across all device types

### Story 2.5: Enhanced 3D Interaction and Polish
As a potential customer,  
I want smooth, professional 3D interactions that build confidence in the final product quality,  
so that I feel assured about placing an order for my custom design.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. 3D model responds smoothly to all user interactions with professional-quality rendering
2. Lighting and shadows enhance the realism of uploaded images and text on the mug surface
3. Animation transitions between different views and customization states feel polished
4. Visual feedback clearly indicates interactive areas and available actions
5. 3D performance remains smooth even with complex uploaded images and text combinations
6. Model automatically returns to optimal viewing angle after period of inactivity
7. Professional visual quality builds confidence in final product manufacturing capabilities
