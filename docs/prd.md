### Background Context

This PRD addresses the critical market entry challenge facing new ceramic mug customization businesses: the chicken-and-egg problem of needing customers to justify inventory investment while customers need quality examples before committing to orders. Traditional approaches require significant upfront investment in physical samples and rely on ineffective static photo galleries that fail to demonstrate customization possibilities.

Our solution leverages interactive 3D visualization technology to showcase unlimited customization possibilities without physical inventory investment. The landing page combines lead generation with an engaging Three.js-powered 3D mug designer that allows visitors to upload designs, customize colors, and see realistic renderings in real-time. This approach transforms uncertain browsers into qualified prospects by providing immediate visual confidence in the final product quality and capabilities.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The landing page should embody a premium, professional aesthetic that immediately conveys quality and trustworthiness while remaining approachable and fun. The design should eliminate friction between visitor arrival and 3D tool engagement, creating a natural flow that feels more like "playing with a cool tool" than "filling out a form." Visual hierarchy should guide users seamlessly from initial value proposition through 3D interaction to lead conversion, with each step feeling inevitable and delightful rather than pushy or sales-heavy.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Progressive Engagement:** Start with simple, low-commitment interactions (viewing the 3D model) that gradually increase investment (uploading images, customizing colors) leading naturally to the higher-commitment lead form submission.

**Touch-First Mobile Experience:** All 3D interactions must work intuitively with finger gestures - pinch to zoom, drag to rotate, tap to select - with visual feedback that makes the digital experience feel as tactile as handling a physical mug.

**Immediate Visual Feedback:** Every user action should produce instant, satisfying visual changes to the 3D model, creating a sense of direct manipulation and creative control that builds confidence in the final product quality.

**Contextual Guidance:** Subtle visual cues and micro-animations guide users through the customization process without overwhelming them, using progressive disclosure to reveal advanced options only when needed.

### Core Screens and Views

**Landing Hero View:** Clean, uncluttered entry point with compelling headline, brief value proposition, hero image or embedded 3D preview, and prominent "Design Your Mug" call-to-action button that immediately conveys the interactive nature of the experience.

**3D Designer Interface:** Full-screen or prominently featured 3D mug model with intuitive control panels for image upload, color selection, and text addition, designed with mobile-first approach for touch interaction and thumb-friendly control placement.

**Lead Capture Modal/Section:** Smoothly integrated form that appears after meaningful 3D engagement, presenting the user's custom design as context while collecting contact information, making the transition feel natural rather than intrusive.

**Mobile-Optimized Layout:** Simplified single-column layout for mobile devices with collapsible tool panels, thumb-friendly button placement, and optimized 3D viewport that maximizes screen real estate for the mug visualization.

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

All interactive elements must be keyboard navigable with clear focus indicators, color choices must meet WCAG AA contrast ratios, and alternative text must be provided for all images and 3D model states. The 3D tool should include keyboard shortcuts for rotation and zoom to accommodate users who cannot use touch or mouse gestures effectively.

### Branding

**Professional Sublimation Quality Aesthetic:** Visual design should convey precision, quality, and professional manufacturing capabilities while remaining warm and approachable. Clean typography, generous whitespace, and high-quality imagery that showcases sublimation printing capabilities without appearing sterile or industrial.

**Modern Web Technology Showcase:** The 3D visualization itself becomes a branding element, demonstrating technical sophistication and innovation that sets the business apart from traditional custom printing competitors using static catalogs or simple photo galleries.

**Trust and Credibility Signals:** Subtle design elements that build confidence - professional photography, clean layouts, clear contact information, testimonials or quality indicators - without overwhelming the primary 3D interaction experience.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**Mobile-First Progressive Enhancement:** Design starts with optimal mobile experience (iPhone/Android), then enhances for tablet and desktop viewports. 3D performance optimization prioritizes mobile devices while taking advantage of additional screen real estate and processing power on larger devices.

**Cross-Platform Consistency:** Unified experience across all device types with platform-appropriate interaction patterns (touch gestures on mobile, mouse controls on desktop) while maintaining consistent visual identity and user flow.
