  }
  ```

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: lib/database/schema.sql and architecture.md#External APIs]
- **Existing Schema**: Complete schema already implemented with leads, designs, and analytics_events tables
- **Indexing Strategy** (already implemented):
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_leads_email ON leads(email);
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_leads_created_at ON leads(created_at);
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_leads_status ON leads(status);
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_designs_created_at ON designs(created_at);
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_designs_is_complete ON designs(is_complete);
  ```
- **Additional Indexing Requirements** (Story 3.2):
  ```sql
  -- Composite indexes for complex queries
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_leads_status_created ON leads(status, created_at);
  CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_leads_source_engagement ON leads(source, engagement_level);
  ```
- **Foreign Key Constraints** (already implemented):
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE leads ADD CONSTRAINT fk_leads_design_id 
      FOREIGN KEY (design_id) REFERENCES designs(id);
  ```

### API Integration Requirements
[Source: app/api/leads/route.ts and architecture.md#REST API Specification]
- **Existing API Endpoint**: POST /api/leads fully implemented with comprehensive validation and error handling
- **Enhancement Requirements for Story 3.2**:
  - Add session tracking data collection from request headers
  - Implement duplicate detection logic before database insertion
  - Add design state validation when designId is provided
  - Enhanced error logging for database operations and constraint violations
- **Response Handling**: Existing 201 success, 400 validation errors, 500 server errors pattern
- **Rate Limiting**: Already implemented with 10 requests per minute per IP
- **Security Headers**: CORS, CSP, and security headers already configured

### Session Tracking Implementation
[Source: architecture.md#External APIs and Story 3.2 requirements]
- **Session ID Generation**: Use crypto.randomUUID() for unique session identifiers
- **Device Detection**: Parse User-Agent header for device type classification
- **Browser Detection**: Extract browser information from User-Agent string
- **Referral Tracking**: Use Referer header and query parameters for source attribution
- **IP Address Handling**: Hash IP addresses for privacy-compliant duplicate detection
- **Implementation Location**: Enhance existing `app/api/leads/route.ts` endpoint

### Duplicate Detection Strategy
[Source: Story 3.2 AC and architecture.md#Data Models]
- **Session-Based Detection**: Prevent multiple submissions within same session ID
- **Email-Based Detection**: Check for existing leads with same email within configurable time window (default: 24 hours)
- **Fingerprinting**: Combine hashed IP, User-Agent, and session data for duplicate identification
- **Merge Logic**: Allow updates to existing leads if user provides additional information
- **Database Implementation**: Use PostgreSQL UNIQUE constraints and INSERT ... ON CONFLICT handling

### Performance Optimization Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#External APIs and NFR5]
- **Connection Pooling**: Supabase automatically handles connection pooling
- **Query Optimization**: Use proper indexing for lead searches and reporting queries
- **Monitoring**: Add query performance logging with execution time tracking
