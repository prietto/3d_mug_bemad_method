## QA Results
*Results from QA Agent review will be populated here after implementation*

## Supersession Notice

**Date:** 2025-09-30
**Superseded By:** Epic 4, Story 4.1 (Minimal Header & Split-Screen Layout)
**Reason:** Strategic pivot to single-page minimalist UX design

This story's implementation remains in git history and represents the initial multi-screen approach. Epic 4 refactors this work into a split-screen layout with minimal header, eliminating the full hero section and CTA navigation pattern.

**Implementation Status:** Code from this story serves as foundation for Epic 4 refactoring. Components like `Navigation.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` are preserved, while `HeroSection.tsx` is simplified to `MinimalHeader.tsx`.
