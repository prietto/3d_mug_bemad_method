## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 3.5 (Performance Monitoring and System Health) completion:
- **Performance Monitoring Infrastructure**: Comprehensive monitoring system with health check endpoints, 3D performance tracking, and circuit breaker patterns
- **Existing Page Structure**: Current implementation uses modal-based 3D designer with progressive engagement flow
- **Component Architecture**: Established patterns for React component testing with Vitest and Testing Library
- **Performance Targets**: Existing performance monitoring validates <3 second page load requirements
- **Mobile Optimization**: Previous stories established mobile-first patterns and touch interaction standards

Key Architectural Context:
- Current page.tsx uses state-driven modal for MugDesigner component (`showDesigner` state)
- HeroSection contains full hero layout with CTA buttons triggering designer modal
- FormTriggerManager handles engagement-based form display logic (to be removed in Story 4.2)
- Navigation and Footer components are already implemented and functional

### Strategic Context from Epic 4
This story initiates the **Single-Page Minimalist UX Transformation** epic, which refactors the landing page from a multi-screen progressive engagement flow to a unified single-page experience. The goal is to reduce conversion friction by eliminating navigation steps between 3D customization and lead capture.

**Supersedes**: Story 1.2 (Landing Page Hero Section) - Replacing full hero section with minimal header
**Relationship to Story 4.2**: This story creates the layout foundation; Story 4.2 will update the form to be always visible

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14.0+ with App Router for page layout components
- **UI Component Library**: Tailwind CSS 3.3+ for utility-first responsive styling
- **State Management**: Zustand 4.4+ (existing, no changes needed for layout refactor)
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript 5.2+ with complete interfaces for component props
- **Testing**: Vitest 1.0+ with @testing-library/react 14.0+ for component testing

### Component Architecture - Split-Screen Layout
[Source: architecture.md#Components and project structure analysis]

**New Components to Create**:
- **MinimalHeader.tsx** - Simplified header component
  - Props: `{ logo?: string, tagline: string }`
  - Max height: 80px
  - Removes hero section elements (CTA buttons, value propositions, large imagery)
  - Preserves brand identity (logo + tagline only)

- **SplitScreenLayout.tsx** - Container managing responsive split layout
  - Props: `{ leftComponent: ReactNode, rightComponent: ReactNode, leftWidthPercent?: number }`
  - Desktop: 60/40 split ratio (configurable via leftWidthPercent prop)
  - Responsive breakpoint: 1024px (Tailwind `lg:` prefix)
  - Mobile: Vertical stack with full-width children
  - CSS transitions: `transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out`

**Components to Modify**:
- **page.tsx** - Main page layout refactor
  - Remove: `showDesigner` state, `handleDesignNowClick`, `handleCloseDesigner` functions
  - Remove: Modal-based MugDesigner rendering
  - Remove: HeroSection component import and usage
  - Add: MinimalHeader component
  - Add: SplitScreenLayout container with MugDesigner and LeadCaptureForm as children
  - Preserve: Navigation and Footer components in layout structure

- **MugDesigner.tsx** - Remove modal-specific props
  - Remove: `onClose` prop and close button functionality
  - Update: Render as inline component instead of modal overlay
  - Optimize: Scale 3D viewport for 60% width constraint vs previous full-width
  - Preserve: All 3D interaction functionality from Epic 2 stories

- **LeadCaptureForm.tsx** - Prepare for always-visible mode (detailed in Story 4.2)
  - Note: Minimal changes in this story; full form refactor in Story 4.2
  - Ensure: Form can render inline within layout (remove modal dependencies if any)

### Performance Optimization Strategy
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack - Performance and Story 3.5 monitoring infrastructure]

**Code Splitting**:
- Use `React.lazy()` for MugDesigner component (heavy Three.js bundle)
- Use `React.lazy()` for LeadCaptureForm component
- Implement `<Suspense>` boundaries with loading indicators
- Target: Initial bundle <200KB, lazy-loaded chunks <500KB each

**Performance Targets**:
- **Page Load Time**: <3 seconds (AC requirement)
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: <1.5 seconds
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: <2.5 seconds
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: <3 seconds
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: <0.1

**Monitoring Integration**:
- Leverage existing performance monitoring from Story 3.5
- Track component load times using `lib/monitoring/performance.ts`
- Monitor layout shift metrics during responsive transitions
- Validate 3D performance maintains >30 FPS in split-screen mode

### Accessibility Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Progressive Enhancement and WCAG standards]

**WCAG AA Compliance**:
- Color contrast ratios: Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- Focus indicators: Visible focus states for all focusable elements
- Screen reader support: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Touch targets: Minimum 44x44px for mobile interactions

**Semantic HTML Structure**:
```html
<header role="banner">
  <nav><!-- Navigation --></nav>
  <div><!-- MinimalHeader --></div>
</header>
<main role="main">
  <section aria-label="3D Mug Designer"><!-- MugDesigner --></section>
  <section aria-label="Contact Form"><!-- LeadCaptureForm --></section>
</main>
<footer role="contentinfo"><!-- Footer --></footer>
```

### Integration with Existing Systems
[Source: Stories 1.2, 2.5, 3.1-3.5 completion and current implementation]

**Preserved Functionality**:
- **Navigation**: Existing Navigation component continues to work without changes
- **Footer**: Existing Footer component continues to work without changes
- **3D Designer**: All Epic 2 functionality preserved (color, image upload, text, rotation, zoom)
- **Analytics**: Existing Google Analytics integration continues tracking events (detailed updates in Story 4.4)
- **Lead Form**: Form submission logic preserved; trigger logic removal in Story 4.2

**Removed Functionality**:
- **Hero Section**: Full hero section with CTA buttons and value propositions removed
- **Modal-Based Designer**: 3D designer modal overlay replaced with inline split-screen rendering
- **Progressive Engagement**: Multi-screen navigation flow replaced with simultaneous visibility

### Testing
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack and established testing patterns]

**Testing Framework**: Vitest 1.0+ with @testing-library/react 14.0+

   - Responsive sizing works on mobile and desktop
   - Accessible with proper ARIA labels

2. **SplitScreenLayout Component**:
   - Renders children in left and right panels on desktop
   - Applies 60/40 split ratio at ≥1024px breakpoint
   - Switches to vertical stack layout at <1024px breakpoint
   - Smooth transitions during viewport resize
   - Accepts custom split ratios via props

3. **Page Layout Integration**:
   - Navigation renders above MinimalHeader
   - MinimalHeader renders below Navigation
   - SplitScreenLayout renders with MugDesigner and LeadCaptureForm
   - Footer renders below SplitScreenLayout
   - No modal overlays present
   - Both designer and form visible simultaneously on load

4. **Performance Validation**:
   - Page load completes within 3 seconds
   - First Contentful Paint <1.5 seconds
   - Largest Contentful Paint <2.5 seconds
   - Cumulative Layout Shift <0.1
   - 3D performance >30 FPS in split-screen mode

5. **Responsive Behavior**:
   - Desktop (≥1024px): 60/40 horizontal split
   - Tablet (768px-1023px): Vertical stack
   - Mobile (<768px): Vertical stack with full-width components
   - Smooth transitions between breakpoints
   - No horizontal scrolling on any viewport size

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation
[Source: Epic 4 risk assessment and architectural considerations]

**Performance Risk (Medium)**: Both components visible simultaneously may impact load time
- **Mitigation**: Code splitting with React.lazy, aggressive bundle optimization, performance monitoring
- **Validation**: Test on slow 3G network, monitor with Story 3.5 performance infrastructure

**Layout Shift Risk (Low)**: Component loading may cause visual layout shifts
- **Mitigation**: Proper Suspense fallbacks, skeleton loaders, fixed height containers
- **Validation**: Measure CLS metric, ensure <0.1 threshold

**Mobile UX Risk (Medium)**: Vertical stack layout may affect user engagement
- **Mitigation**: Extensive mobile testing, clear visual separation, proper spacing
- **Validation**: User testing, analytics tracking (Story 4.4)

**3D Performance Risk (Low)**: 3D rendering in 60% width constraint may impact performance
- **Mitigation**: Optimize 3D viewport scaling, maintain existing performance optimizations from Story 2.5
- **Validation**: FPS monitoring, maintain >30 FPS target from Story 3.5

### Dependencies and Sequencing
**Depends On**:
- Story 1.2 (Landing Page Hero Section) - Navigation and Footer components
- Story 2.5 (Enhanced 3D Interaction) - MugDesigner component functionality
- Story 3.1 (Smart Lead Capture Form) - LeadCaptureForm component

**Enables**:
- Story 4.2 (Always-Visible Lead Capture Form) - Requires split-screen layout foundation
- Story 4.3 (Optimized 3D Viewer) - Requires inline 3D rendering context
- Story 4.4 (Simplified Analytics) - Requires new layout for analytics tracking updates

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

### Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented the minimal header and split-screen layout refactor. Created two new components (MinimalHeader and SplitScreenLayout) and refactored the main page.tsx to use the new layout structure. Implemented React.lazy and Suspense for performance optimization.

### File List
**New Files Created:**
- app/components/MinimalHeader.tsx
- app/components/MinimalHeader.test.tsx
- app/components/SplitScreenLayout.tsx
- app/components/SplitScreenLayout.test.tsx

**Modified Files:**
- app/page.tsx (complete refactor)
- app/components/MugDesigner.tsx (removed modal functionality, converted to inline component)
- app/page.test.tsx (updated for new layout structure)
- app/components/MinimalHeader.test.tsx (fixed imports for global test functions)
- app/components/SplitScreenLayout.test.tsx (fixed imports, updated custom width test)
- vitest.config.ts (added test file pattern configuration)

**Files to be Modified in Future Stories:**
- app/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx (Story 4.2)
- app/components/FormTriggerManager.tsx (Story 4.2 - to be removed)

### Debug Log References
QA Review Fixes Applied - 2025-09-30:
- Fixed INFRA-001: Vitest configuration issue - removed erroneous imports of global test functions
- Fixed TECH-001: Tailwind JIT dynamic class generation - switched to flex-basis inline styles for custom widths
- Fixed TEST-001: Updated page.test.tsx to reflect new MinimalHeader + SplitScreenLayout structure
- Attempted INFRA-002: .next directory permission errors require manual intervention (Windows file lock issue)

### Completion Notes
**Initial Implementation (v1.1):**
- ✅ MinimalHeader component created with max 80px height constraint
- ✅ SplitScreenLayout component created with 60/40 split ratio
- ✅ Main page refactored to use new layout structure
- ✅ React.lazy and Suspense implemented for performance
- ✅ Responsive styles applied (mobile-first, lg:flex-row)
- ✅ Navigation and Footer preserved in layout
- ✅ MugDesigner converted from modal to inline component

**QA Fixes Applied (v1.3):**
- ✅ Fixed test infrastructure - tests now execute successfully (MinimalHeader: 6 passing, SplitScreenLayout: 8 passing, page.tsx: 7 passing)
- ✅ Fixed Tailwind JIT issue in SplitScreenLayout - replaced dynamic class generation with flex-basis inline styles
- ✅ Updated page.test.tsx integration tests for new layout structure
- ✅ Added test file pattern to vitest.config.ts for better test discovery
- ⚠️ Build process blocked by Windows .next directory permissions (requires manual cleanup or admin privileges)
- 🔄 Performance testing pending (blocked by build issue)
- 🔄 Cross-browser testing pending

### Known Issues
1. **Build Permissions (Windows)**: .next/trace file has permission lock preventing clean build. Requires manual intervention: delete .next directory or run as administrator.
2. **LeadCaptureForm Integration**: Currently using placeholder design data. Full integration pending Story 4.2.
3. **Performance Validation**: Cannot measure 3-second load time target until build succeeds.

### Next Steps
1. User to manually delete .next directory or run build as administrator
2. Verify build process completes successfully
3. Perform manual testing of responsive layouts in browser
4. Test performance metrics with Lighthouse
5. Prepare for Story 4.2 (Always-Visible Lead Capture Form)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** GOOD with critical blockers preventing full validation

The implementation demonstrates solid architectural decisions and clean component design. The MinimalHeader and SplitScreenLayout components are well-structured with proper TypeScript interfaces, semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and responsive Tailwind classes. The refactored page.tsx successfully removes modal patterns and implements code splitting via React.lazy/Suspense.

**Strengths:**
- Clean component separation with clear single responsibilities
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout (MinimalHeaderProps, SplitScreenLayoutProps)
- Semantic HTML structure with appropriate ARIA labels (role="banner", aria-label)
- Responsive-first design with mobile-first Tailwind classes
- Performance-conscious code splitting implementation
- Good test coverage for new components (6 tests for MinimalHeader, 8 tests for SplitScreenLayout)

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Test Infrastructure Failure** - All tests show "No test suite found" error, preventing validation
2. **Build Process Blocked** - Permission errors with .next directory preventing build execution
3. **Integration Gap** - page.test.tsx not updated to reflect new layout structure
4. **Performance Validation Missing** - Cannot verify 3-second load time requirement without working build

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed during this review due to test infrastructure and build failures preventing safe code changes. The existing implementation appears sound but requires working test/build infrastructure before attempting improvements.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards:** ⚠️ CANNOT VERIFY - No coding-standards.md file found in docs/architecture/
- **Project Structure:** ✓ PASS - Components correctly placed in app/components/, tests adjacent to components
- **Testing Strategy:** ✗ FAIL - Test infrastructure broken, preventing test execution
- **All ACs Met:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Implementation appears complete, but cannot validate without working tests/build

### Acceptance Criteria Validation

| AC | Requirement | Status | Evidence | Test Coverage |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | Minimal header (logo + tagline, max 80px) | ✓ LIKELY | MinimalHeader.tsx has `maxHeight: '80px'` inline style | MinimalHeader.test.tsx lines 22-27 |
| 2 | Split-screen layout (3D + form) | ✓ LIKELY | SplitScreenLayout.tsx renders leftComponent/rightComponent | SplitScreenLayout.test.tsx lines 6-16 |
| 3 | Desktop 60/40 split at 1024px breakpoint | ✓ LIKELY | `lg:w-3/5` and `lg:w-2/5` classes applied | SplitScreenLayout.test.tsx lines 30-43 |
| 4 | Mobile vertical stack layout | ✓ LIKELY | `flex-col lg:flex-row` responsive classes | SplitScreenLayout.test.tsx lines 60-70 |
| 5 | Navigation and Footer preserved | ✓ CONFIRMED | page.tsx lines 90, 116 render Navigation/Footer | Visual inspection only |
| 6 | Page loads within 3 seconds | ❌ BLOCKED | React.lazy/Suspense implemented but cannot measure | Build required for performance testing |
| 7 | Responsive layout with smooth transitions | ✓ LIKELY | `transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out` classes | SplitScreenLayout.test.tsx lines 72-87 |

**Status Summary:** 5 of 7 ACs likely met, 1 blocked by infrastructure, 1 confirmed. Full validation requires working test/build infrastructure.

### Requirements Traceability - Given-When-Then Mapping

**AC1: Minimal Header**
- **Given** a user visits the landing page
- **When** the page loads
- **Then** they see a header with logo and tagline constrained to 80px max height
- **Test Mapping:** MinimalHeader.test.tsx lines 22-27 validate height constraint

**AC2: Split-Screen Layout**
- **Given** a user is on desktop viewport (≥1024px)
- **When** the page renders
- **Then** they see 3D designer (left, 60%) and lead form (right, 40%) side-by-side
- **Test Mapping:** SplitScreenLayout.test.tsx lines 6-16, 30-43

**AC3: Desktop Split Ratio**
- **Given** viewport width ≥1024px
- **When** layout renders
- **Then** left panel receives 60% width, right panel receives 40%
- **Test Mapping:** SplitScreenLayout.test.tsx lines 30-43 (class-based validation)

**AC4: Mobile Vertical Stack**
- **Given** viewport width <1024px
- **When** layout renders
- **Then** components stack vertically with full width
- **Test Mapping:** SplitScreenLayout.test.tsx lines 45-58, 60-70

**AC5: Navigation & Footer Preservation**
- **Given** previous stories implemented Navigation/Footer
- **When** new layout renders
- **Then** these components remain functional in their positions
- **Test Mapping:** MISSING - page.test.tsx not updated (task marked incomplete)

**AC6: Performance (<3 seconds)**
- **Given** a user visits the page
- **When** both 3D designer and form load
- **Then** page becomes interactive within 3 seconds
- **Test Mapping:** MISSING - No performance tests exist, "Add performance monitoring" task incomplete

**AC7: Smooth Responsive Transitions**
- **Given** viewport resizes across breakpoints
- **When** layout adjusts
- **Then** transitions are smooth with 300ms duration
- **Test Mapping:** SplitScreenLayout.test.tsx lines 72-87 validate CSS classes

**Coverage Gaps:**
- No integration tests for full page layout assembly
- No performance tests measuring actual load times
- No cross-browser compatibility tests
- No mobile device testing (touch interactions, viewport variations)
- No accessibility tests (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Unit Test Quality:** EXCELLENT (where present)
- MinimalHeader: 6 well-structured tests covering props, styles, semantics
- SplitScreenLayout: 8 comprehensive tests covering layout, responsive behavior, ARIA
- Tests use proper Testing Library queries (getByRole, getByLabelText)
- Descriptive test names following "it should..." pattern

**Test Infrastructure Status:** CRITICAL FAILURE
- **Vitest Configuration Issue:** All test files return "No test suite found"
- **Root Cause Unknown:** Could be vitest.config.ts misconfiguration, file resolution issues, or module loading problems
- **Impact:** ZERO tests can execute, blocking all validation

**Coverage Gaps - Integration Level:**
- page.test.tsx not updated for new layout (task incomplete line 47)
- No tests for MugDesigner in inline mode (without onClose prop)
- No tests for LeadCaptureForm in always-visible split-screen context
- No tests for React.lazy/Suspense fallback rendering
- No tests for Navigation/Footer integration with new layout

**Coverage Gaps - E2E Level:**
- No performance tests for 3-second load requirement (AC6)
- No mobile device testing (AC4 validation)
- No cross-browser tests (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No slow network simulation (3G testing noted as incomplete)

**Test Strategy Concerns:**
1. **Blocking Issue:** Test infrastructure must be fixed before story can proceed
2. **Integration Tests Missing:** Unit tests exist but integration validation absent
3. **Performance Validation Absent:** Critical AC6 (3-second load) has no automated validation
4. **Manual Testing Required:** Without working automated tests, relying on manual validation (high risk)

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

**Security: ✓ PASS**
- No security-sensitive code changes in this story
- No authentication, payment, or data handling modifications
- Components are presentational with no security surface area
- Notes: Future stories (4.2+) must validate form input sanitization

**Performance: ⚠️ CONCERNS**
- **Positive Indicators:**
  - React.lazy() implemented for MugDesigner and LeadCaptureForm
  - Suspense boundaries with loading fallbacks present
  - Lazy loading should reduce initial bundle size
- **Concerns:**
  - Cannot measure actual load times without working build
  - No performance monitoring in place to validate 3-second target (AC6)
  - MugDesigner.tsx still shows embedded modal-style controls (lines 144-295), unclear if this impacts 60% width performance
  - Task "Add performance monitoring for component load times" incomplete (line 54)
  - Task "Test on slow 3G network connections" incomplete (line 55)
- **Risk:** Medium - Implementation looks reasonable but unvalidated

**Reliability: ⚠️ CONCERNS**
- **Positive:**
  - Error boundaries present in MugDesigner (lines 129-138)
  - Loading states handled via Suspense fallbacks
- **Concerns:**
  - Test infrastructure failure prevents reliability validation
  - Build process has permission errors, suggesting environment issues
  - No error handling tests for Suspense boundary failures
  - No validation of graceful degradation if 3D fails to load

**Maintainability: ✓ PASS**
- Clean component architecture with single responsibilities
- TypeScript provides type safety throughout
- Props interfaces well-defined (MinimalHeaderProps, SplitScreenLayoutProps, MugDesignerProps)
- Responsive classes use consistent Tailwind patterns
- Code is readable and follows React best practices
- Minor issue: SplitScreenLayout dynamic class generation (lines 16-17) uses template literals that may not work with Tailwind's JIT compiler (see Technical Debt section)

### Security Review

**Findings:** ✓ NO CONCERNS

This story introduces no security-sensitive functionality:
- No user input handling (form submission stays in LeadCaptureForm, unchanged)
- No authentication or authorization changes
- No data persistence modifications
- No external API calls introduced
- No XSS vectors in new components (logo prop could be validated in future)

**Future Considerations:**
- Story 4.2 will make LeadCaptureForm always-visible; must validate input sanitization
- Logo prop in MinimalHeader should validate URL to prevent XSS if user-controllable

### Performance Considerations

**Implemented Optimizations:**
1. **Code Splitting:** React.lazy() for MugDesigner and LeadCaptureForm reduces initial bundle
2. **Suspense Boundaries:** Loading fallbacks prevent empty screen during component load
3. **Responsive Images:** Logo uses responsive classes (h-8 sm:h-10)

**Unvalidated Assumptions:**
- Cannot confirm bundle size reduction without build
- Cannot measure First Contentful Paint (FCP) or Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Cannot validate 3-second load target (AC6) without performance testing

**Performance Risks:**
1. **3D Viewport Scaling:** MugDesigner now renders in 60% width but component code suggests it may not be optimized for this constraint (no viewport scaling logic visible)
2. **Simultaneous Component Load:** Both heavy components (3D + form) load simultaneously; may exceed 3-second budget on slow networks
3. **Mobile Performance:** Vertical stack on mobile loads full-width 3D designer at top; may delay form visibility

**Recommendations:**
1. Fix build process and run `npm run build` to analyze bundle sizes
2. Implement performance monitoring for component load times (incomplete task)
3. Test on simulated slow 3G (incomplete task)
4. Consider lazy-loading form only after 3D designer is interactive (progressive enhancement)

### Testability Evaluation

**Controllability:** ✓ GOOD
- Components accept clear props for all inputs
- Design state can be controlled via props (currentDesign in page.tsx)
- Responsive behavior controlled by viewport width (testable via Testing Library)

**Observability:** ✓ GOOD
- Components render semantic HTML with ARIA labels
- Loading states observable via Suspense fallbacks
- Error states observable via error prop in MugDesigner

**Debuggability:** ⚠️ CONCERNS
- Test infrastructure issues make debugging difficult
- No source maps mentioned for production debugging
- Error messages in MugDesigner are generic

### Technical Debt Identification

**High Priority (Address Before Production):**

1. **Test Infrastructure Failure** (CRITICAL)
   - **Issue:** All tests show "No test suite found" despite test files existing
   - **Location:** Project-wide Vitest configuration issue
   - **Impact:** Cannot validate any implementation, blocks QA process
   - **Recommendation:** Debug vitest.config.ts, check file resolution, verify tsconfig paths
   - **Effort:** 2-4 hours

2. **Build Process Permission Errors** (CRITICAL)
   - **Issue:** Windows permission issues with .next/trace file
   - **Location:** .next directory permissions
   - **Impact:** Cannot run production build, cannot measure performance
   - **Recommendation:** Clear .next directory, check file locks, run as administrator if needed
   - **Effort:** 1-2 hours

3. **Tailwind JIT Compiler Incompatibility** (HIGH)
   - **Issue:** Dynamic class generation in SplitScreenLayout (lines 16-17) uses template literals
   - **Code:** `lg:w-[${leftWidthPercent}%]`
   - **Problem:** Tailwind's JIT compiler may not generate these classes at build time
   - **Impact:** Custom split ratios may not render correctly in production
   - **Recommendation:** Use safelist in tailwind.config.js or switch to predefined width classes
   - **Effort:** 1 hour

4. **Integration Tests Missing** (HIGH)
   - **Issue:** page.test.tsx not updated for new layout (task incomplete line 47)
   - **Impact:** No validation of full page integration
   - **Recommendation:** Update page.test.tsx to test new layout structure
   - **Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Medium Priority (Address in Next Sprint):**

5. **Performance Testing Absent** (MEDIUM)
   - **Issue:** AC6 requires <3 second load but no performance tests exist
   - **Impact:** Cannot validate critical acceptance criteria
   - **Recommendation:** Implement performance tests using Lighthouse CI or similar
   - **Effort:** 4-6 hours

6. **MugDesigner Modal Remnants** (MEDIUM)
   - **Issue:** MugDesigner.tsx still has embedded control panel (lines 144-295) designed for modal context
   - **Impact:** May not be optimized for 60% width split-screen rendering
   - **Recommendation:** Review if control panel should be external for better split-screen layout
   - **Effort:** 3-4 hours

7. **Cross-Browser Testing Absent** (MEDIUM)
   - **Issue:** Task "Test on multiple browsers" incomplete (line 82)
   - **Impact:** Layout may break in Safari, Firefox, or Edge
   - **Recommendation:** Set up Playwright or BrowserStack for cross-browser testing
   - **Effort:** 4-6 hours

**Low Priority (Future Improvements):**

8. **Accessibility Testing Incomplete** (LOW)
   - **Issue:** No automated accessibility tests (axe-core, Pa11y)
   - **Impact:** WCAG compliance unvalidated
   - **Recommendation:** Add @axe-core/react or similar to test suite
   - **Effort:** 2-3 hours

9. **Logo Prop Validation Missing** (LOW)
   - **Issue:** MinimalHeader logo prop accepts any string, no URL validation
   - **Impact:** Potential for invalid image paths or XSS if user-controlled
   - **Recommendation:** Add URL validation or TypeScript branded type
   - **Effort:** 1 hour

10. **Loading Fallback UX** (LOW)
    - **Issue:** Loading spinners are basic, no skeleton screens
    - **Impact:** Perceived performance could be better
    - **Recommendation:** Implement skeleton screens matching component layout
    - **Effort:** 2-3 hours

### Files Modified During Review

None - review was read-only due to test infrastructure failures preventing safe refactoring.

**Developer Action Required:**
- Update File List in Dev Agent Record section if any files are modified to address issues above

### Gate Status

**Gate:** FAIL → [docs/qa/gates/4.1-minimal-header-split-screen-layout.yml](docs/qa/gates/4.1-minimal-header-split-screen-layout.yml)

**Critical Blockers:**
1. Test infrastructure completely non-functional (cannot execute any tests)
2. Build process blocked by permission errors (cannot validate bundle sizes or performance)
3. Integration tests missing (page.test.tsx not updated)
4. Performance requirement (AC6: 3-second load) unvalidated

**Summary:** Implementation appears architecturally sound with excellent unit test design, but critical infrastructure failures prevent validation. Test and build systems must be fixed before this story can be considered complete.

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - Critical Infrastructure Issues**

**Blocking Issues:**
1. Fix test infrastructure (Vitest configuration)
2. Resolve build permission errors
3. Fix Tailwind JIT dynamic class generation
4. Update integration tests (page.test.tsx)
5. Validate performance requirements with working build

**Story owner must address all critical checklist items before proceeding to Story 4.2.** The code implementation itself appears solid, but cannot be validated without working test and build infrastructure.
