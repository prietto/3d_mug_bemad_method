# Story 2.2: Mug Color Customization

## Status
âœ… COMPLETED

## Story
**As a** potential customer,  
**I want** to change the base color of the mug to match my design preferences,  
**so that** I can see how different color combinations will look together.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Color picker displays 3-5 predefined mug base colors (white, black, blue, red, green)
2. Clicking/tapping a color immediately updates the 3D model with smooth transition animation
3. Color changes maintain uploaded image visibility and quality on the mug surface
4. Selected color is visually indicated in the color picker interface
5. Color changes work smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices
6. Default white color is preselected when users first access the designer
7. Color selection state is maintained when users navigate within the application

### Data Models Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Data Models]
- **Design Interface** (already defined in Story 2.1):
  ```typescript
  interface Design {
    id: string;
    mugColor: string; // Selected base color - this story's primary focus
    uploadedImageBase64?: string;
    uploadedImageUrl?: string;
    customText?: string;
    textFont?: string;
    textPosition?: string; // JSON string for PostgreSQL JSONB storage
    createdAt: string;
    lastModified: string;
    isComplete: boolean;
  }
  ```

### 3D Designer Engine Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#3D Designer Engine]
- **Material Updates**: Use Three.js MeshStandardMaterial or MeshLambertMaterial for mug base color
- **Texture Compatibility**: Ensure color changes work with uploaded image textures from Story 2.1
- **Animation**: Implement smooth color transitions using Three.js material.color.lerp() or similar
- **Performance**: Optimize material updates to maintain 30+ FPS on mobile devices
- **WebGL Compatibility**: Ensure color rendering works across different mobile GPU capabilities

### Component Specifications Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Mobile-First UI Components]
- **ColorPicker Component**: Touch-friendly color selection interface with visual feedback
  - Must integrate with existing MugDesigner modal from Story 1.4
  - Should follow accessibility guidelines for color selection
  - Props: `selectedColor: string`, `onColorChange: (color: string) => void`, `colors: string[]`
- **MugModel Enhancement**: Extend existing MugModel to support dynamic color changes
  - Add `mugColor` prop to update Three.js material properties
  - Maintain compatibility with uploaded textures from Story 2.1
