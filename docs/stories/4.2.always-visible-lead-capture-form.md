## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 4.1 (Minimal Header & Split-Screen Layout) completion:
- **Split-Screen Layout Implemented**: SplitScreenLayout component manages 60/40 desktop split and vertical mobile stack
- **Form Already Integrated**: LeadCaptureForm is already rendered in page.tsx within SplitScreenLayout rightComponent
- **Modal Logic Removed**: Story 4.1 removed modal-based MugDesigner; LeadCaptureForm still has onDismiss prop but it's stubbed as no-op
- **Performance Optimizations**: React.lazy and Suspense implemented for both MugDesigner and LeadCaptureForm
- **Responsive Foundation**: Mobile-first Tailwind classes established for layout transitions at 1024px breakpoint

From Story 3.1 (Smart Lead Capture Form Trigger) implementation:
- **Form Fields**: LeadCaptureForm has name, email, phone, projectDescription fields with validation
- **GDPR Compliance**: ConsentCheckbox component integrated with privacy policy links
- **Validation Logic**: Email format, phone format (optional), project description minimum length validation
- **API Integration**: Form submits to POST /api/leads with CreateLeadRequest interface
- **Engagement Tracking**: FormTriggerManager manages trigger logic based on engagement scoring (to be removed)
- **Design Preview**: DesignPreview component shows user's customization in form context
- **Analytics Integration**: Google Analytics events tracked for form triggers, submissions, dismissals

Key Technical Context:
- **FormTriggerManager.tsx** currently handles:
  - Engagement-based trigger conditions (hasUploadedImage, hasCustomizedText, hasChangedColor)
  - Periodic checking for trigger conditions (2-second intervals)
  - Form visibility state management (isVisible, isDismissed, dismissCount)
  - API submission logic to /api/leads
  - Analytics event tracking (form_trigger, form_submit, form_dismiss, form_error)
- **designStore.ts** contains:
  - formState interface (isVisible, isDismissed, dismissCount, lastEngagementTime)
  - engagement interface (hasUploadedImage, hasCustomizedText, hasChangedColor, interactionCount, timeSpent, engagementScore)
  - shouldTriggerForm() method implementing engagement scoring algorithm
  - showForm(), hideForm(), dismissForm() methods for form state management

### Strategic Context from Epic 4

Story 4.2 is the second story in the **Single-Page Minimalist UX Transformation** epic. This story completes the removal of progressive engagement patterns by eliminating all trigger-based logic and making the lead capture form always visible.

**Supersedes**: Story 3.1 (Smart Lead Capture Form Trigger) - Replacing trigger-based form display with always-visible approach
**Depends On**: Story 4.1 (Minimal Header & Split-Screen Layout) - Requires split-screen layout foundation
**Enables**: Story 4.4 (Simplified Analytics) - Requires simplified form state for analytics updates

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: Story 3.1 Dev Notes and Story 4.1 implementation]
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14.0+ with App Router (already implemented)
- **State Management**: Zustand 4.4+ for design state (engagement tracking to be simplified)
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form patterns with TypeScript validation (already implemented in LeadCaptureForm)
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS 3.3+ for responsive styling (already established in Story 4.1)
- **API Integration**: Next.js API routes at /api/leads (no changes required)
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4 for event tracking (updated to remove trigger events)
- **Testing**: Vitest 1.0+ with @testing-library/react 14.0+ (established pattern)

### Component Specifications

### Performance Considerations
[Source: Story 4.1 performance optimization strategy]

**Code Splitting**:
- LeadCaptureForm already lazy-loaded via React.lazy() in page.tsx (Story 4.1)
- Suspense boundary with loading fallback already implemented
- Removal of FormTriggerManager reduces overall bundle size

**Performance Targets** (inherited from Story 4.1):
- Page Load Time: <3 seconds
- First Contentful Paint (FCP): <1.5 seconds
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): <2.5 seconds
- Time to Interactive (TTI): <3 seconds
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): <0.1

**Performance Monitoring**:
- Leverage existing performance monitoring from Story 3.5
- Track form visibility on page load
- Monitor form submission response times

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation
[Source: Epic 4 risk assessment]

**User Experience Risk (Low)**: Always-visible form may feel intrusive to some users
- **Mitigation**: Clear visual hierarchy, non-intrusive design, proper spacing in split-screen layout
- **Validation**: User feedback, analytics tracking of form interaction rates

**Conversion Risk (Low-Medium)**: Removing triggers may impact conversion timing
- **Mitigation**: A/B testing framework in Story 4.4, ability to rollback if conversion drops
- **Validation**: Conversion rate monitoring, time-to-first-form-interaction metric

**Technical Risk (Low)**: Removing FormTriggerManager and designStore logic may introduce bugs
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, gradual refactoring, preserve API integration unchanged
- **Validation**: Integration tests, manual testing across devices and browsers

### Dependencies and Sequencing

**Depends On**:
- Story 4.1 (Minimal Header & Split-Screen Layout) - Requires split-screen layout foundation and LeadCaptureForm integration

**Enables**:
- Story 4.3 (Optimized 3D Viewer) - Simplified state management allows focus on 3D performance
- Story 4.4 (Simplified Analytics) - Requires removal of trigger events for analytics updates

**Preserves**:
- Story 1.5 (Backend API and database) - API endpoint unchanged
- Story 3.2 (Lead data storage) - Data model unchanged
- Story 3.4 (Automated notifications) - Email notifications continue to work
- Story 3.5 (Performance monitoring) - Performance tracking infrastructure unchanged

## Testing

### Testing Framework
- **Framework**: Vitest 1.0+ with @testing-library/react 14.0+
- **Test Location**: Create test files adjacent to components as `Component.test.tsx`
- **Testing Standards**: Follow established patterns from Stories 1.1-4.1

### Test Coverage Requirements
- Unit tests for LeadCaptureForm always-visible behavior
- Unit tests for designStore simplification (trigger logic removed)
- Integration tests for page layout with always-visible form
- Mobile responsive tests for vertical stack layout
- Accessibility tests for form compliance
- Cross-browser compatibility tests

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation** with well-structured component refactoring and comprehensive feature removal. The story successfully transforms the lead capture form from trigger-based to always-visible while maintaining all validation logic, GDPR compliance, and mobile optimization. The code demonstrates solid React patterns, proper TypeScript usage, and thoughtful UX considerations.

### Refactoring Performed

During review, I identified and fixed several test issues to improve test reliability:

- **File**: `app/components/3d/TextInput.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed ambiguous button selector in test that was finding multiple elements with same name
  - **Why**: Test was failing due to DOM query finding both clear button and dialog button
  - **How**: Updated to use exact text match instead of regex to target specific button

- **File**: `app/components/3d/TextSizeControls.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Fixed multiple text label assertions using `getAllByText()[index]` instead of `getByText()`
  - **Why**: Size labels appear in multiple places (header and scale references) causing test failures
  - **How**: Explicitly target first or second occurrence using array indexing for clarity

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent adherence to React/TypeScript patterns, clean component structure
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Proper file organization, component co-location with tests
