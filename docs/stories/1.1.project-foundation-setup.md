## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in Epic 1, establishing the foundation for all subsequent development work.

### Data Models
Based on architecture document requirements, implement these core TypeScript interfaces:

**Lead Interface** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
```typescript
interface Lead {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  phone?: string;
  projectDescription: string;
  designId?: string;
  createdAt: string; // ISO string for PostgreSQL compatibility
  source: string;
  engagementLevel: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  status: 'new' | 'contacted' | 'qualified' | 'converted';
}
```

**Design Interface** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
```typescript
interface Design {
  id: string;
  mugColor: string;
  uploadedImageBase64?: string; // Store as base64 for simplicity
  customText?: string;
  textFont?: string;
  textPosition?: string; // JSON string for PostgreSQL storage
  createdAt: string; // ISO string for PostgreSQL compatibility
  lastModified: string; // ISO string for PostgreSQL compatibility
  isComplete: boolean; // Track if design is ready for lead capture
}
```

### API Specifications
Initial API routes to create [Source: architecture.md#api-specification]:
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint
- `POST /api/leads` - Lead capture endpoint
- `POST /api/designs` - Design persistence endpoint
- `GET /api/designs/:id` - Design retrieval endpoint
- `PUT /api/designs/:id` - Design update endpoint

### File Locations
Based on Next.js 14+ App Router structure:
- `/app` - Main application directory with App Router
- `/app/api` - API routes directory
- `/lib` - Shared utilities and database connections
- `/lib/types` - TypeScript interface definitions
- `/components` - Reusable React components
- `/public` - Static assets and 3D models

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack Requirements** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Next.js 14.0+ with App Router
- TypeScript 5.2+
- Supabase PostgreSQL for database
- Three.js 0.156+ and React Three Fiber 8.15+ for 3D graphics
- Tailwind CSS 3.3+ for styling
- Vitest 1.0+ and Testing Library 14.0+ for testing
- Vercel for deployment platform

**Database Configuration**:
- Use Supabase PostgreSQL for both development and production
- Schema must support Lead and Design entities as defined
- Leverage Supabase built-in indexing and performance optimizations

### Environment Variables Required
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- **Test Framework**: Vitest 1.0+ (Jest alternative optimized for modern development)
- **React Testing**: @testing-library/react 14.0+ for component testing
- **Test File Location**: Co-locate test files with source files using `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extensions
- **Testing Patterns**: Unit tests for utilities, integration tests for API routes, component tests for React components
- **Coverage Requirements**: Focus on critical business logic (Lead capture, Design persistence)
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright 1.40+ for end-to-end testing (to be configured in later stories)

**Specific Testing Requirements for this Story**:
- Unit tests for TypeScript interfaces validation
- Integration tests for API route structure
- Supabase database connection and schema tests
- Environment configuration validation tests
- Supabase client initialization and authentication tests
