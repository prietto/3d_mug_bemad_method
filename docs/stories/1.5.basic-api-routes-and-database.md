## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[From Story 1.4 completion]
- Development server successfully running on port 3001 due to port conflict resolution
- TypeScript configuration is properly set up with strict mode
- Comprehensive testing patterns established using Vitest and Testing Library
- File structure follows Next.js 14 app directory conventions with proper organization

### Database Architecture and Configuration
[Source: architecture.md#Data Models and lib/database/schema.sql]
- **Database Choice**: Currently using Supabase PostgreSQL instead of SQLite as originally specified in epic
- **Connection Pattern**: Use `createServerClient()` from `lib/supabase.ts` for API routes with service role key
- **Schema Already Defined**: Complete schema exists in `lib/database/schema.sql` with leads, designs, and analytics_events tables
- **Data Models**: TypeScript interfaces defined in `lib/types/index.ts` for Lead, Design, and API request/response types

### Existing API Infrastructure
[Source: Current codebase inspection]
- **Health Check**: Already implemented in `app/api/health/route.ts` with basic functionality
- **Leads API**: Already implemented in `app/api/leads/route.ts` with full CRUD operations
- **Designs API**: Already implemented in `app/api/designs/route.ts` with POST operation
- **Environment Setup**: Supabase environment variables already configured (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY)

### File Locations and Structure
[Source: architecture.md#unified-project-structure and current codebase]
- **API Routes**: `app/api/` directory following Next.js 14 app router structure
- **Database Utilities**: `lib/` directory for shared database and type definitions
- **Types**: `lib/types/index.ts` for TypeScript interfaces
- **Test Files**: Adjacent to source files with `.test.ts/.test.tsx` extension
- **Schema**: `lib/database/schema.sql` for database schema definition

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture.md#REST API specification]
- **Lead API**: POST /api/leads with email, name, projectDescription (required), phone, designId, source, engagementLevel (optional)
- **Design API**: POST /api/designs with mugColor (required), uploadedImageBase64, customText, textFont, textPosition (optional)
- **Design Retrieval**: GET /api/designs/:id for retrieving specific design by UUID
- **Response Format**: All APIs return `{success: boolean, data?: T, error?: string}` format

### Environment Configuration Requirements
[Source: Current .env setup and architecture.md]
- **Database**: Supabase connection requires URL, anon key, and service role key
- **Development**: Use .env.local for local development configuration
- **Production**: Vercel environment variables for production deployment
- **Validation**: Environment variable validation already exists in `lib/supabase.ts`

### Error Handling and Logging Patterns
[Source: Current API implementations in app/api/]
- **Error Response Format**: Consistent `{success: false, error: string}` format
- **HTTP Status Codes**: 400 for validation errors, 500 for server errors, 201 for successful creation
- **Console Logging**: Use `console.error()` for database and server errors
- **Database Errors**: Proper error handling for Supabase client errors

### Integration Points
[Source: architecture.md and current implementation]
- **Frontend Integration**: APIs designed to work with React components and 3D designer
- **Analytics Integration**: Design for future integration with Google Analytics tracking
- **Lead Capture Flow**: Designs can be associated with leads through designId reference
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for request/response types

**CRITICAL NOTE**: The epic specifies SQLite database, but the current implementation uses Supabase PostgreSQL. The infrastructure is already in place and working. This story should focus on completing any missing functionality rather than changing the database technology.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack and established patterns from Story 1.4]
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest 1.0+ with @testing-library/react 14.0+ for API route testing
- **Test Location**: Create test files adjacent to API routes as `route.test.ts`
- **Testing Requirements**: 
  - Unit tests for all API route handlers with request/response validation
  - Integration tests for database operations and error handling
  - Environment configuration tests for missing variables
  - API endpoint tests with mock database responses
- **Testing Patterns**: Use Vitest's request mocking and database mocking patterns
- **Coverage**: Test all HTTP methods, validation logic, error scenarios, and successful responses

### Specific Testing Requirements for Story 1.5
- Test health check endpoint returns proper status and database connectivity
- Verify leads API validates required fields and email format
- Test designs API handles creation, retrieval, and updates correctly
- Validate proper error responses for invalid requests and database failures
- Test environment variable validation and missing configuration scenarios
- Verify consistent response format across all API endpoints
- Test database connection pooling and error recovery scenarios
