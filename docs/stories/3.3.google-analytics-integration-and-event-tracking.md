### Data Models Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Data Models and lib/types/index.ts]
- **AnalyticsEvent Interface** (already implemented):
  ```typescript
  interface AnalyticsEvent {
    id: string;                    // UUID primary key
    sessionId: string;             // Browser session identifier
    eventType: 'page_view' | 'mug_rotate' | 'color_change' | 'image_upload' | 'text_add' | 'lead_capture';
    eventData: Record<string, any>; // Event-specific data payload
    timestamp: Date;               // When event occurred
    userAgent: string;             // Device/browser information
    leadId?: string;               // Associated lead (if available)
  }
  ```
- **Enhanced Analytics Requirements** (New for Story 3.3):
  ```typescript
  interface GA4Event {
    eventName: string;             // GA4 event name
    parameters: Record<string, any>; // GA4 event parameters
    userId?: string;               // User identifier for journey tracking
    sessionId: string;             // Session correlation
    timestamp: number;             // Unix timestamp for GA4
  }

  interface EngagementMetrics {
    rotationCount: number;         // Number of 3D rotations
    zoomEvents: number;            // Zoom in/out interactions
    timeSpent: number;             // Total engagement time in seconds
    customizationPath: string[];   // Sequence of customization actions
    engagementDepth: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'; // Calculated engagement level
  }

  interface ConversionFunnelStep {
    step: 'page_view' | '3d_engagement' | 'customization' | 'lead_capture';
    timestamp: Date;
    metadata: Record<string, any>; // Step-specific data
    previousStep?: string;         // Journey tracking
  }
  ```

### Analytics Engine Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#Components and Analytics Event Processing Workflow]
- **Component Responsibility**: Analytics Tracking Engine captures user interactions with 3D designer and conversion funnel events
- **Key Interfaces**:
  - `trackEvent(event: AnalyticsEvent)` - Record user interaction event
  - `trackPageView(page: string, metadata: object)` - Track page navigation
  - `trackConversionFunnel(step: string, metadata: object)` - Monitor conversion progress
- **Event Processing Workflow**:
  1. 3D Engine triggers user interaction (rotate, zoom, customize)
  2. Analytics Engine adds event to batch queue for performance
  3. Batch processor sends events to GA4 via Measurement Protocol
  4. Events stored in Supabase analytics_events table for business intelligence
  5. Error handling with exponential backoff for failed GA4 requests

### 3D Interaction Tracking Integration
[Source: existing 3D components and Stories 2.1-2.5 completion]
- **Integration Points**:
  - `app/components/3d/Scene.tsx` - Core 3D scene with orbit controls and rotation tracking
