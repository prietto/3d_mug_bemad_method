### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js 0.156+ + React Three Fiber 8.15+ for WebGL-based 3D mug rendering and interaction
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14.0+ with App Router for SSR/SSG optimization
- **State Management**: Zustand 4.4+ for lightweight React state management of 3D scene state
- **Performance**: Webpack 5.0+ optimization configured for Three.js in next.config.js

### 3D Designer Engine Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#Components]
- **Responsibility**: Core 3D mug visualization and interaction functionality using Three.js and React Three Fiber for WebGL-based rendering with touch-optimized controls
- **Key Interfaces**: 
  - `onDesignChange(design: Design)` - Notify parent components of design updates
  - `loadDesign(design: Design)` - Load existing design configuration into 3D scene
  - `exportDesignPreview()` - Generate static image preview for lead capture
- **Dependencies**: Three.js, React Three Fiber, Zustand design store, file upload service
- **Technology Stack**: TypeScript, React Three Fiber, Three.js, WebGL, Zustand for 3D state management

### Mobile-First UI Components Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Components]
- **Key Interfaces**:
  - `<MugDesigner />` - Main 3D designer container component
  - Touch-friendly interaction patterns optimized for mobile devices
- **Dependencies**: Tailwind CSS, Headless UI, React Three Fiber, Zustand

### Performance Requirements
[Source: PRD Requirements]
- **NFR1**: The 3D tool shall load and become interactive within 5 seconds on standard broadband connections to prevent user abandonment
- **NFR2**: Cross-browser compatibility with Chrome 90+, Safari 14+, Firefox 88+, and Edge 90+ on desktop and mobile devices
- **NFR3**: Handle mobile 4G connections gracefully with optimized 3D model loading
- **Performance Target**: Three.js model optimization with texture compression, progressive loading for 3D assets
- **Target Devices**: iPhone 12+, Samsung Galaxy S21+, devices with Mali-G76 GPU or equivalent for 30+ FPS requirement

### File Structure and Locations
[Source: Project Structure]
- **3D Components**: Create in `app/components/` directory following established pattern
- **Main Component**: `app/components/MugDesigner.tsx` - Main 3D designer container
- **Sub-components**: 
  - `app/components/3d/Scene.tsx` - Three.js scene wrapper
  - `app/components/3d/MugModel.tsx` - 3D mug model component
  - `app/components/3d/Controls.tsx` - Camera and interaction controls
- **Integration**: Update `app/page.tsx` to replace placeholder CTA with actual 3D designer
- **Test Files**: Create adjacent test files as `ComponentName.test.tsx`

### Data Models and State Management
[Source: architecture.md#Data Models]
- **Design Interface**: 
  - `id: string (UUID)` - Unique identifier
  - `mugColor: string` - Selected base color
  - `uploadedImageUrl: string` - User-uploaded image reference  
  - `customText: string` - User-added text
  - `textFont: string` - Selected font family
  - `textPosition: object` - 3D positioning data
  - `createdAt: Date` - Design creation timestamp
  - `lastModified: Date` - Last interaction timestamp
- **State Management**: Use Zustand for 3D scene state and design configuration

### Three.js Configuration Requirements
[Source: next.config.js and package.json]
- **Webpack Optimization**: Already configured in next.config.js for Three.js with externals for utf-8-validate and bufferutil
- **Dependencies**: Three.js 0.156.0, @react-three/fiber 8.15.0, and @react-three/drei 9.88.0 already installed
- **TypeScript**: @types/three 0.156.0 for proper type definitions
- **Database**: @supabase/supabase-js 2.38.0 for PostgreSQL integration (not SQLite)

### Performance and Mobile Optimization
[Source: architecture.md#Performance]
- **Mobile Performance**: 3D performance optimization prioritizes mobile devices while taking advantage of additional screen real estate and processing power on larger devices
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced with interactive features
- **Touch Controls**: Touch controls must feel natural - pinch to zoom, drag to rotate, tap to select
- **Fallback Strategy**: Static high-quality mug image with CSS transforms for rotation simulation when WebGL is unavailable
- **Database Integration**: Supabase PostgreSQL for design persistence and lead capture (configured in package.json)

### Integration with Existing Hero Section
[Source: Current app/page.tsx and HeroSection.tsx]
- **Current State**: HeroSection component has onDesignNowClick prop that currently logs placeholder message
- **Integration Point**: Replace placeholder console.log with actual 3D designer component display
- **Layout Requirements**: 3D viewport should be properly sized and positioned within landing page layout
- **Mobile Responsive**: Maintain existing mobile-first responsive design patterns

### Current File Context
Based on project structure, the current implementation has:
- `app/page.tsx` - Home page with Navigation, HeroSection, Footer layout
- `app/components/HeroSection.tsx` - Hero section with CTA button calling onDesignNowClick
- Established component testing patterns with Vitest and Testing Library
- Complete Tailwind CSS responsive design system

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack and Story 1.2 patterns]
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest 1.0+ with @testing-library/react 14.0+ for component testing
- **Test Location**: Create test files adjacent to components as `ComponentName.test.tsx`
