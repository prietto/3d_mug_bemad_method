## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.3 completion, the existing infrastructure provides:
- **Design Store Architecture**: Complete Zustand store with resetToDefault action already implemented
- **ResetButton Component**: Basic camera reset functionality exists, needs enhancement for full design reset
- **MugDesigner Modal**: Established interface pattern for integrating new design controls
- **Mobile Optimization**: 44px+ touch targets and responsive design patterns established
- **Testing Infrastructure**: React Testing Library patterns with Three.js mocking established
- **State Management Patterns**: Proven patterns for design element state management (color, image, text)

### Tech Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14.0+ with App Router for SSR/SSG optimization
- **State Management**: Zustand 4.4+ for lightweight React state management of design reset state
- **UI Components**: Tailwind CSS 3.3+ + Headless UI 1.7+ for utility-first styling and accessible reset controls
- **Testing**: Vitest 1.0+ with @testing-library/react 14.0+ for component and interaction testing
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js 0.156+ + React Three Fiber 8.15+ for 3D state transitions during reset

### Data Models Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Data Models and lib/types/index.ts]
- **Design Interface** (already fully defined in previous stories):
  ```typescript
  interface Design {
    id: string;
    mugColor: string;
    uploadedImageBase64?: string;
    uploadedImageUrl?: string;
    customText?: string;
    textFont?: string;
    textPosition?: string; // JSON string for 3D coordinates
    textSize?: number;
    textColor?: string;
    createdAt: string;
    lastModified: string;
    isComplete: boolean;
  }
  ```
- **Reset Configuration Options**:
  ```typescript
  interface ResetOptions {
    resetImage?: boolean;
    resetColor?: boolean;
    resetText?: boolean;
    resetAll?: boolean;
    confirmation?: boolean;
  }
  ```

### Component Specifications Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Mobile-First UI Components and existing patterns]
- **Enhanced ResetButton Component**: Full design reset with confirmation dialog
  - Props: `resetType: 'all' | 'image' | 'color' | 'text'`, `showConfirmation: boolean`, `onReset: () => void`
  - Features: Confirmation dialog, visual feedback, mobile-optimized touch targets
- **ResetConfirmationDialog Component**: Prevents accidental design loss
  - Props: `isOpen: boolean`, `onConfirm: () => void`, `onCancel: () => void`, `resetType: string`
  - Features: Clear messaging, keyboard navigation, mobile-friendly buttons
- **VisualFeedback Component**: Success/error notifications for design operations
  - Props: `message: string`, `type: 'success' | 'error' | 'info'`, `duration: number`
  - Features: Toast notifications, smooth animations, auto-dismiss functionality

### Design Store Enhancements Requirements
[Source: app/components/3d/store/designStore.ts and established patterns]
- **Current Reset Functionality**: `resetToDefault()` action already exists and resets full design
- **Selective Reset Actions** (need to be added):
  - `resetImage()` - Clear uploaded image only
  - `resetColor()` - Reset to default white mug color only
  - `resetText()` - Clear custom text and reset text properties only
  - `resetElement(element: 'image' | 'color' | 'text')` - Generic selective reset
- **Visual Feedback Integration**: Actions to trigger toast notifications and loading states

### File Structure and Locations
[Source: Project Structure and Previous Stories]
- **Enhance Existing**:
  - `app/components/3d/ResetButton.tsx` - Enhance to support full design reset with confirmation
  - `app/components/3d/ResetButton.test.tsx` - Expand test coverage for new functionality
  - `app/components/3d/store/designStore.ts` - Add selective reset actions

  - `app/components/3d/VisualFeedback.test.tsx` - Feedback system test suite
- **Integration Updates**:
  - `app/components/MugDesigner.tsx` - Integrate reset options into modal interface

### Mobile-First Design Requirements
[Source: architecture.md#Mobile-First UI Components and established patterns]
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px touch targets for all reset buttons and controls
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear hover and active states for reset interaction controls
- **Responsive Layout**: Reset controls should work in both portrait and landscape orientations
