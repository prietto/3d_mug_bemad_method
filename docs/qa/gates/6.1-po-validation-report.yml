    Story 6.1 has been comprehensively validated and approved for implementation.

    Template Compliance: 100% (10/10 sections)
    PO Master Checklist: 92% (improved from 85%)
    Technical Accuracy: 100% (all claims verified)
    Developer Clarity: 9/10
    Implementation Readiness: HIGH

    The story demonstrates exceptional quality with:
    - Zero blocking issues
    - All acceptance criteria testable and mapped to tasks
    - Comprehensive rollback strategy
    - Performance monitoring instrumentation
    - Clear technical guidance with code examples

    Minor improvements applied through 3 versions (1.0 → 1.1 → 1.2) have
    elevated this from a good story to an excellent, production-ready story.

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  pre_implementation: []  # None - story is ready

  during_implementation:
    - "Use performance.now() instrumentation as specified in Testing section"
    - "Monitor console for warnings during geometry creation"
    - "Test with various image sizes and aspect ratios"

  post_implementation:
    - "Visual inspection required to confirm no gap (AC1)"
    - "FPS validation during interaction (AC8)"
    - "Regression testing of all 12 ACs"
    - "Update Dev Agent Record section with implementation notes"
