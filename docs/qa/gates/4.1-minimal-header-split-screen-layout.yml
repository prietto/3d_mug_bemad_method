schema: 1
story: "4.1"
story_title: "Minimal Header & Split-Screen Layout"
gate: FAIL
status_reason: "Critical infrastructure failures block validation: test system non-functional, build process blocked, integration tests missing, performance requirements unvalidated. Implementation appears architecturally sound but cannot be verified."

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security-sensitive changes introduced. Components are presentational with no auth, payment, or data handling modifications."

  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "React.lazy/Suspense implemented correctly but cannot measure actual load times. 3-second target (AC6) unvalidated. Build blocked."

  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Error boundaries present in MugDesigner, Suspense fallbacks exist, but cannot test error scenarios due to test infrastructure failure."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean component architecture, TypeScript interfaces well-defined, responsive patterns consistent. Minor Tailwind JIT issue noted."

    reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
    note: "Initial review - critical infrastructure issues block validation despite solid implementation"

next_steps:
  - "Developer must fix test infrastructure (vitest.config.ts)"
  - "Developer must resolve build permission errors"
  - "Developer must address Tailwind JIT dynamic class issue"
  - "Developer must update integration tests (page.test.tsx)"
  - "Once infrastructure working, re-submit for QA review"
  - "Do NOT proceed to Story 4.2 until gate passes"
