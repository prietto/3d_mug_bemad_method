nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Template data is static and pre-vetted. No XSS vulnerabilities. Template IDs validated. No user-supplied template data. Rate limiting from Story 8.3 applies to template generations."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Templates load instantly (static data, ~2-3KB bundle size). Thumbnails optimized as WebP <20KB each. Responsive grid performs well. Next.js Image component provides optimization. No lazy loading needed for current 7 templates."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling through parent component. Template selection gracefully updates state. Proper fallback to manual prompt entry. Template validation functions prevent invalid data."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization. Clear separation: data (lib/templates), UI (components), state (store). TypeScript types well-defined. Helper functions (getTemplateById, validateTemplate) promote reusability. JSDoc documentation present."
