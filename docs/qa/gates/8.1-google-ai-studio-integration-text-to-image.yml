nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "API key properly secured server-side, comprehensive input validation, no client-side exposure. Minor: Consider adding request timeout (10s)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Async non-blocking API calls, target <5s generation time met (2-4s typical). Loading states provide clear UX feedback. Minor: Add timeout configuration."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling for all failure modes (network, auth, rate limit, validation). Graceful degradation with manual upload fallback."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization with TypeScript interfaces, proper separation of concerns, self-documenting code. 24 comprehensive tests document expected behavior."

code_quality_highlights:
  strengths:
    - "Clean architectural separation (API route, state, UI components)"
    - "Comprehensive TypeScript type safety throughout"
    - "Excellent error handling with user-friendly messages"
    - "Security-first approach (API key server-side only)"
    - "Backward compatible integration with existing texture pipeline"
    - "Thoughtful UX (keyboard shortcuts, loading states, character counter)"
    - "24 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios"

  architecture_decisions:
    - decision: "Reuse existing uploadedImageUrl state field"
      rationale: "Single source of truth, avoids duplication, simpler integration"
      impact: "Excellent - reduces complexity and maintains consistency"
    - decision: "Server-side API route for Google AI Studio calls"
      rationale: "Protects API key, centralizes error handling, enables future rate limiting"
      impact: "Excellent - proper security and extensibility"
    - decision: "Async non-blocking generation"
      rationale: "Maintains UI responsiveness during 2-4s API calls"
      impact: "Excellent - good UX during generation"
