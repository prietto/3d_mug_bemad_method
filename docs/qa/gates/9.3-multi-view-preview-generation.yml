      - "Track multi-view adoption rate via analytics to measure feature value"
      - "Monitor partial failure rates to ensure angle generation stability"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper rate limiting integration (each view counts toward quota). Design ID validation present. API key protected server-side. View angle validation prevents injection. RLS policies apply to designs table. No security vulnerabilities identified."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Sequential generation time ~6-12 seconds acceptable for 2 additional views. Database JSONB storage efficient. Caching strategy prevents redundant API calls. Thumbnails generated client-side. Keyboard navigation responsive. Progressive display improves perceived performance."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling including partial failures (some views succeed, others fail). Rate limiting properly enforced. Database transaction safety. Multi-view is optional (doesn't block lead capture). Graceful degradation to single view on errors."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean separation: angle definitions (lib/multiView), API route, UI component, state management. TypeScript interfaces well-defined. Helper functions promote reusability. Database migration properly documented. Code follows established patterns from Stories 9.1/9.2."
