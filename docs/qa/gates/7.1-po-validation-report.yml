# BLOCKING ISSUES
blocking_issues:
  - id: "REQUIREMENT-CONFLICT-001"
    severity: CRITICAL
    category: "Requirements Contradiction"
    finding: |
      Story 7.1 AC #1-2 contradict Story 6.1 (Done) AC #1.

      Story 6.1 AC #1: "Image sits flush on mug surface (no gap)"
      Story 6.1 Status: Done (implemented, Dev Agent confirmed)
      Story 6.1 Code: radius changed from 1.23 to 1.2

      Story 7.1 AC #1: "Image texture sits completely flush against mug surface with no visible gap"
      Story 7.1 Dev Notes (line 76-80): "Even after Story 6.1 fix (radius 1.23 â†’ 1.2), there's still a slight visible gap"

      This creates a logical contradiction:
      - If Story 6.1 satisfied its AC #1, then no gap should exist
      - If gap still exists, then Story 6.1 AC #1 was NOT satisfied (QA failure)
      - Story 7.1 was likely written BEFORE 6.1 implementation

    impact: |
      Cannot proceed with implementation until resolved:
      1. If gap does NOT exist (6.1 succeeded): Remove AC #1-2 from Story 7.1
      2. If gap DOES exist (6.1 failed): Re-open Story 6.1 as QA failure
      3. If this is a NEW/DIFFERENT gap: Document the distinction clearly

    required_action: |
      VISUAL VERIFICATION REQUIRED:
      1. Deploy/run current implementation (with Story 6.1 and 6.2 Done)
      2. Upload test image to mug
      3. Inspect visually if gap exists between image and mug surface
      4. If gap exists: Measure and document (screenshot, description)
      5. Update Story 7.1 based on findings

    category: "Story Scope"
    finding: |
      Story 7.1 combines 3 SEPARATE, UNRELATED enhancements:

      Enhancement 1: Fix image gap (relates to Epic 6 - Visual Quality)
      - AC #1-2
      - Task 1
      - Related to Story 6.1 (already Done)

      Enhancement 2: Enhance image size control (new feature)
      - AC #3-5
      - Task 2
      - Width/height proportional scaling

      Enhancement 3: Restructure controls layout (UX improvement)
      - AC #6-10
      - Tasks 3-4
      - 2-column grid, sticky canvas, responsive design

      These are 3 distinct concerns that could be 3 separate stories.

    impact: |
      - Increases implementation complexity
      - Mixes different types of work (bug fix + feature + UX)
      - Makes rollback harder (can't rollback one part without others)
      - Violates single responsibility principle
      - If one enhancement fails QA, entire story blocked

    recommendation: |
      Consider splitting into 3 stories:
      - Story 7.1a: Image gap fine-tuning (IF gap exists after 6.1)
      - Story 7.1b: Image size control enhancement (width/height scaling)
      - Story 7.1c: Controls layout restructure (2-column, sticky canvas)

      Benefits of splitting:
      - Independent implementation and testing
      - Separate rollback capability
      - Clearer acceptance criteria per story
      - Better tracking of progress
      - Each story has single focus

  overall_assessment: |
    Story 7.1 is BLOCKED due to critical requirement contradiction with Story 6.1 (Done).

    CRITICAL BLOCKERS:
    1. Gap fix (AC #1-2) contradicts Story 6.1 which already fixed gap and is Done
    2. Testing subsection not properly nested in Dev Notes (template violation)
    3. Story combines 3 separate enhancements (scope creep concern)

    VERIFICATION REQUIRED:
    - Visual inspection of current implementation to confirm gap status
    - Decision on whether to proceed with gap fix, remove it, or document difference

    RECOMMENDATION:
    Story should be split into 2-3 separate stories after gap verification:
    - Story 7.1 (or remove): Image gap refinement (if gap exists)
    - Story 7.2: Image size control enhancement
    - Story 7.3: Controls layout restructure

    Quality of technical content is GOOD (detailed analysis, code examples),
    but requirements clarity and scope management need improvement.

      - "Fix Testing subsection structure"
      - "Add rollback strategy"

      - "Move AC #1-2 from Story 7.1 back to Story 6.1"
      - "Story 7.1 proceeds with AC #3-13 only (size control + layout)"
      - "Consider splitting 7.1 into 7.1 (size) + 7.2 (layout)"
      - "Fix Testing subsection structure"
      - "Add rollback strategy"
      - "Add release notes"

  option_c:
    title: "Gap is DIFFERENT from 6.1 gap (New Issue)"
    actions:
      - "Document distinction between 6.1 gap and 7.1 gap in Dev Notes"
      - "Update AC #1-2 to clarify this is RESIDUAL or DIFFERENT gap"

      - "Fix Testing subsection structure"

      - "Add release notes"
    result: "Story 7.1 proceeds with all enhancements, but gap fix is clarified as refinement"

  recommended_option: "option_a"
  recommendation_rationale: |
    Option A is most likely based on evidence:
    - Story 6.1 Status: Done (Dev Agent confirmed)
    - Story 6.1 code implemented (radius = 1.2)
    - Story 7.1 written before 6.1 implementation (assumptions outdated)
    - No QA failure reports for Story 6.1

    However, VISUAL VERIFICATION must confirm before proceeding.

    version: "1.0"
    gate: BLOCKED
    note: |
      Initial validation reveals critical requirement contradiction with Story 6.1 (Done).
      Story 7.1 AC #1-2 assume gap still exists after 6.1, but 6.1 is marked Done.
      Visual verification required. Also identified scope creep (3 separate enhancements)
      and template violation (Testing subsection). Story blocked pending resolution.

  - at: "2025-10-02T18:00:00Z"
    version: "1.0"
    gate: APPROVED_WITH_CONDITIONS
    note: |
      Story approved conditionally per user request. Approval conditions added to story:
      1. Dev agent must verify gap existence before implementing AC #1-2
      2. If no gap: Skip AC #1-2 (Story 6.1 already fixed)
      3. If gap exists: Proceed but document why 6.1 was insufficient
      4. Incremental implementation recommended (size control â†’ layout)
      5. Testing subsection should be moved (template compliance note)

      Rationale for conditional approval:
      - Good technical content and analysis
      - Dev agent flexibility to adjust scope based on reality
      - Template issues are guidance, not blockers
      - Scope concerns documented for dev agent awareness

      Risk accepted: Dev agent responsible for verifying gap status.
