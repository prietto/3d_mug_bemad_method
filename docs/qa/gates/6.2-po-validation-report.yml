  notes: |
    This is one of the best root cause analyses seen in a story.
    It provides:
    1. The exact problematic code
    2. The error message
    3. The WHY it happened (attempted fix for hooks violation)
    4. The domino effect (empty string fallback introduced bug)

# Solution options analysis
solution_options:
  total_options: 3
  quality: EXCELLENT

  option_1:
    name: "Suspense with separate ImageMesh component"
    complexity: medium
    maintainability: high
    performance: medium
    risk: low
    code_completeness: 100  # Full working code provided

  option_2:
    name: "Default transparent texture"
    complexity: low
    maintainability: medium
    performance: high
    risk: low
    code_completeness: 80  # Partial code provided

  option_3:
    name: "Conditional components at parent level"
    complexity: high
    maintainability: low
    performance: highest
    risk: low
    code_completeness: 60  # Concept shown, not full implementation

  recommendation:
    option: 1
    rationale_quality: GOOD  # Improved in v1.1
    justification_provided: true
    trade_offs_explained: true

    rationale_v1_1: |
      - Clean separation: Image loading isolated from Mug component
      - React best practices: Follows React Three Fiber patterns
      - Error handling: Suspense boundary provides graceful fallback
      - Maintainability: Easier to debug and test image loading separately
      - Trade-off: Slightly less performant than Option 3, but gain significant code clarity

# Epic alignment
epic_alignment:
  epic: "Epic 6: 3D Visual Quality Improvements"
  alignment_status: JUSTIFIED

  rationale: |
    While Story 6.2 is a HOTFIX for a runtime error (not originally planned),
    it directly impacts the 3D visual quality user experience. Console errors
    degrade perceived quality and professionalism, aligning with Epic 6's goal
    of improving visual quality and realism.

  added_to_epic: true
  epic_version: "1.1"

  relationship_to_6_1:
    connection: "Complementary - both improve 3D visual quality"
    dependency: "May be introduced by 6.1 changes (conditional loading)"
    sequence: "Can be implemented in parallel or sequentially"

# Risk assessment (PO perspective)
risk_assessment:
  overall_risk_level: LOW

  implementation_risk:
    level: LOW
    rationale: "Three well-documented solution options, recommended option uses standard React patterns"

  user_impact_risk:
    level: POSITIVE
    rationale: "Fixes console error, improves perceived quality, no visual changes"

  rollback_readiness:
    level: HIGH
    rationale: "6 rollback criteria defined, 5-step procedure, alternative fallback options (Option 2/3)"

  performance_risk:
    level: LOW
    rationale: "Suspense boundary minimal overhead, monitoring specified (55+ FPS threshold)"

  regression_risk:
    level: LOW
    rationale: "Comprehensive regression testing in tasks, existing functionality explicitly tested"

# Rollback strategy evaluation
rollback_strategy:
  status: COMPREHENSIVE
  quality_score: 9  # out of 10

  rollback_criteria:
    count: 6
    specificity: HIGH
    triggers:
      - "New errors appear in console after deployment"
      - "Image upload functionality broken"
      - "Performance degradation (FPS drops below 55)"
      - "Text rendering broken or affected"
      - "Suspense boundary causes loading flicker issues"
      - "User reports of image display problems"

  rollback_procedure:
    steps: 5
    clarity: HIGH
    procedure:
      - "Identify trigger condition from criteria"
      - "Git revert to previous useLoader implementation"
      - "Deploy reverted code immediately"
      - "Monitor for 24 hours"
      - "Re-attempt fix with alternative option (Option 2 or 3)"

    option_2_available: true
    option_3_available: true
