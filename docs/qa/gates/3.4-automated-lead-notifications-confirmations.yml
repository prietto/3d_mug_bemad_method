nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'GDPR compliance implemented with token-based unsubscribe, secure SHA256 hashing for tokens, proper token validation (64-char hex format). Email addresses validated with regex. Development mode prevents accidental real email sending.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Async non-blocking email delivery implemented correctly using sendEmailAsync with exponential backoff retry (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s). Lead capture API response not blocked by email sending. Max 5 retry attempts prevents infinite loops.'
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Robust retry logic and error handling in place. However, database persistence for email_deliveries table is TODO, which means no audit trail or ability to retry failed emails after process restart. Fallback notification mechanism mentioned but not implemented.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Code is well-structured with clear separation of concerns: emailService (SendGrid integration), emailTemplates (HTML generation), emailDelivery (retry logic), gdpr (token management). Comprehensive TypeScript typing with dedicated types/email.ts. Inline documentation present.'

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: 'Implement database schema for email_deliveries and email_preferences tables in Supabase'
      refs: ['app/api/email/unsubscribe/route.ts', 'app/api/email/preferences/route.ts']
      rationale: 'Required for GDPR compliance audit trail and email delivery monitoring'
    - action: 'Fix test runner configuration to enable test suite collection and execution'
      refs: ['vitest.config.ts', 'package.json']
      rationale: 'Cannot validate 61 test cases are passing without functional test runner'
  future:
    - action: 'Implement logEmailFailure database persistence for monitoring dashboard'
      refs: ['lib/utils/emailDelivery.ts:96-112']
      rationale: 'Enable production monitoring and manual retry of failed emails'
    - action: 'Add integration tests for complete lead-to-email flow'
      refs: ['app/api/leads/route.ts:373-433']
      rationale: 'Validate end-to-end workflow with mocked SendGrid API'
    - action: 'Consider implementing email template preview endpoint for testing'
      refs: ['lib/services/emailTemplates.ts']
      rationale: 'Allow manual verification of email appearance before sending'
    - action: 'Add rate limiting to email API endpoints to prevent abuse'
      refs: ['app/api/email/unsubscribe/route.ts', 'app/api/email/preferences/route.ts']
      rationale: 'Protect against potential DOS attacks on public endpoints'

architecture_review:
  strengths:
    - 'Clean separation of concerns across service/utility layers'
    - 'Proper async/await error handling throughout'
    - 'Development mode stub prevents accidental real email sends'
    - 'Mobile-responsive HTML email templates with inline CSS'
    - 'Comprehensive TypeScript typing with dedicated email types'
    - 'SendGrid integration follows official SDK patterns'
  considerations:
    - 'Email templates are currently static strings - consider template engine for complex scenarios'
    - 'No email queuing system - relies on in-process async calls'
    - 'Business email address hardcoded in env vars - consider multi-recipient support'

test_architecture_assessment:
  test_coverage:
    unit_tests: 'Comprehensive - 61 test cases across 6 test files'
    integration_tests: 'None identified'
    e2e_tests: 'None identified (manual testing mentioned for email client rendering)'
  test_quality:
    strengths:
      - 'Proper mocking of external dependencies (@sendgrid/mail)'
      - 'Edge case coverage (missing tokens, invalid formats, retry exhaustion)'
      - 'Both happy path and error scenarios tested'
      - 'Template rendering tests validate all dynamic content inclusion'
    gaps:
      - 'Cannot verify tests execute successfully due to test runner issues'
      - 'No integration tests for SendLeadNotificationEmails function'
      - 'Database TODO sections not tested (appropriately marked as future work)'
  testability_score: 85
  notes: 'Code is highly testable with clear function boundaries and mockable dependencies. Test runner configuration issues are environmental, not code-related.'
