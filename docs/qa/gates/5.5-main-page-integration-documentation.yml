    - action: "Consider adding E2E tests for main page rendering"
      refs: ["app/page.tsx"]
      priority: medium
      rationale: "Automated tests would catch integration regressions in SimpleMugTest usage"
    - action: "Restore lazy loading in Phase 5 (Performance & Polish)"
      refs: ["app/page.tsx"]
      priority: medium
      rationale: "Tracked in feature roadmap. Improves initial bundle size and load time."
    - action: "Consider automated documentation validation tests"
      refs: [".ai/3d-mug-rendering-fix.md"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Could validate documentation completeness and required sections"

# Additional context
notes: |
  This story successfully integrates SimpleMugTest into the main page and creates
  exceptional documentation of the Epic 5 troubleshooting effort.

  Integration Quality:
  - Clean component swap (MugDesigner â†’ SimpleMugTest)
  - Simplified for debugging (removed Suspense/lazy loading)
  - Improves reliability from 0% to 100% render success
  - 60 FPS performance vs infinite loading

  Documentation Quality:
  The .ai/3d-mug-rendering-fix.md file is comprehensive and valuable:
  - Clear problem statement and root cause analysis
  - Before/after code examples for all changes
  - Testing validation and results
  - 5-phase feature roadmap for incremental development
  - Technical debt inventory with priorities
  - Performance baseline metrics
  - Lessons learned for future reference

  This documentation serves multiple purposes:
  1. Knowledge transfer for team members
  2. Troubleshooting guide for similar issues
  3. Development roadmap for next features
  4. Historical context for git archaeology

  Technical Debt Tracking:
  Five items formally documented:
  1. MugDesigner component rebuild (HIGH priority)
  2. Lazy loading restoration (MEDIUM priority)
  3. Error boundaries (MEDIUM priority)
  4. TypeScript strictness (LOW priority)
  5. Testing coverage (LOW priority)

  Feature Roadmap:
  Clear 5-phase incremental development plan aligns with Epic 2
  requirements and provides stable path forward.
