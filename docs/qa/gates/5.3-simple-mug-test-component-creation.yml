# NFR Validation Results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Low risk - rendering component with minimal security surface. File upload validation present in evolved version."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent - 60 FPS achieved, negligible memory usage, <2s load time"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "High - 100% render success vs original MugDesigner. Standard Three.js features with wide browser support."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Good - Clear intent, simple original code (~95 lines). Current evolved version (543 lines) may benefit from decomposition."

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Consider adding unit tests if component becomes production-critical"
      refs: ["app/components/SimpleMugTest.tsx"]
      priority: medium
      rationale: "Component has evolved from demo to feature-rich implementation. Automated tests would protect against regressions."
    - action: "Consider component decomposition as complexity grows"
      refs: ["app/components/SimpleMugTest.tsx"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Current 543-line file could be split into Mug, Controls, and container components for better maintainability."
    - action: "Consider performance benchmarking tests"
      refs: ["app/components/SimpleMugTest.tsx"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Automated performance testing would catch FPS regressions as features are added."
    - action: "Document Phase 1-4 enhancements as formal stories"
      refs: ["app/components/SimpleMugTest.tsx"]
      priority: low
      rationale: "Component has evolved beyond original story scope. Formal documentation would improve traceability."

# Additional context
notes: |
  This component successfully achieved its primary goal: proving that Three.js
  rendering works in the application. The SimpleMugTest component replaced the
  failing MugDesigner component during Epic 5 troubleshooting.

  IMPORTANT: The component has evolved significantly beyond the original story
  scope. The current file (543 lines) includes features from Phases 1-4 of the
  feature roadmap:
  - Phase 1: Color picker (added)
  - Phase 2: Text customization (added)
  - Phase 3: Image upload (added)
  - Phase 4: Enhanced visuals (added - Environment, shadows, PBR materials)

  The original story acceptance criteria describe the INITIAL simple version
  created during troubleshooting - basic primitives, simple lighting, OrbitControls.
  This review validates against those original criteria, which were fully met.

  The evolution is expected and positive, following the incremental development
  approach outlined in the feature roadmap. However, these enhancements should
  ideally be documented as separate stories for better traceability.
