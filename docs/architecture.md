This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Custom Ceramic Mug Landing Page, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

### Starter Template Assessment

**Decision:** N/A - Greenfield project (proceeding with custom architecture)

After reviewing the PRD and documentation, this appears to be a **greenfield project** with no existing starter templates mentioned. However, given the specific requirements for 3D visualization and lead generation, I would recommend considering:

1. **Next.js + Three.js starter** - For React-based 3D web applications
2. **T3 Stack** - TypeScript, Next.js, tRPC, Prisma for fullstack type safety
3. **Vercel + Supabase template** - For rapid deployment with integrated backend services

### Architecture Summary

This architecture combines a modern React-based frontend with Three.js for 3D visualization, backed by a serverless API layer for lead capture and design storage. The system prioritizes mobile-first performance, rapid deployment, and cost-effective scaling to meet the goal of generating 50+ leads within 3 months.

**Key Integration Points:**
- Frontend React app communicates with serverless API endpoints
- 3D designer stores temporary designs in browser, persists final designs via API
- Lead capture integrates Google Analytics for conversion tracking
- MongoDB stores lead data and associated design preferences

### Change Log

| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2025-09-25 | v1.0 | Initial architecture creation | Winston (Architect) |

## High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

The system follows a **Jamstack architecture** with serverless backend services, deployed on Vercel with Supabase for database and authentication. The frontend is a Next.js React application featuring Three.js for 3D mug visualization, optimized for mobile-first interactions. The backend consists of serverless API routes handling lead capture, design persistence, and analytics integration. This architecture achieves the PRD goals through performance-optimized 3D experiences that convert visitors into qualified leads at the target 8-12% conversion rate.

### Platform and Infrastructure Choice

Based on the PRD requirements for rapid market validation, mobile-first performance, and cost-effective scaling, I'm presenting these platform options:

**Option 1: Vercel + Supabase (Recommended)**
- **Pros:** Instant deployment, built-in CDN, excellent Next.js integration, managed database with real-time capabilities, integrated auth
- **Cons:** Vendor lock-in, serverless function limits, higher costs at scale
- **Best for:** Rapid development and validation phase

**Option 2: AWS Full Stack**
- **Pros:** Complete control, cost-effective at scale, extensive service ecosystem
- **Cons:** Higher complexity, longer setup time, requires DevOps expertise
- **Best for:** Long-term scalability and enterprise requirements

**Option 3: Netlify + Firebase**
- **Pros:** Excellent frontend deployment, Google ecosystem integration, real-time database
- **Cons:** Less Next.js optimization than Vercel, Firebase complexity for simple use cases

**Recommendation:** **Vercel + Supabase** for optimal development velocity and built-in performance optimizations crucial for 3D mobile experiences.

**Platform:** Vercel  
**Key Services:** Supabase (PostgreSQL), Vercel Edge Functions, Vercel Analytics, Supabase Auth  
**Deployment Host and Regions:** Global CDN with primary edge in North America/Europe

### Repository Structure

**Structure:** Monorepo using npm workspaces  
**Monorepo Tool:** npm workspaces (lightweight, no additional tooling overhead)  
**Package Organization:** Apps (web, api) + shared packages (types, UI components, utilities)

**Rationale:** Monorepo enables shared TypeScript interfaces between frontend and backend, critical for type-safe 3D designer state and lead capture data. npm workspaces chosen over Turborepo/Nx for simplicity during market validation phase.

## Components

Based on the architectural patterns, tech stack, and data models, I've identified these major logical components across the fullstack:

### 3D Designer Engine

**Responsibility:** Core 3D mug visualization and interaction functionality using Three.js and React Three Fiber for WebGL-based rendering with touch-optimized controls.

**Key Interfaces:**
- `onDesignChange(design: Design)` - Notify parent components of design updates
- `loadDesign(design: Design)` - Load existing design configuration into 3D scene
- `exportDesignPreview()` - Generate static image preview for lead capture

**Dependencies:** Three.js, React Three Fiber, Zustand design store, file upload service

**Technology Stack:** TypeScript, React Three Fiber, Three.js, WebGL, Zustand for 3D state management

### Lead Capture Service

**Responsibility:** Handle lead form submission, validation, and persistence with analytics integration for conversion tracking. In the single-page UX model (Epic 4), this service supports always-visible forms without engagement-based trigger logic.

## Core Workflows

Here are the critical user journeys from the PRD illustrated as sequence diagrams:

### Primary User Journey: Single-Page 3D Customization to Lead Capture

**Note:** This workflow reflects the Epic 4 single-page UX model where both the 3D tool and lead form are visible simultaneously from page load.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant UI as Mobile UI
    participant 3D as 3D Designer Engine
    participant Form as Lead Form (Always Visible)
    participant Store as Design Store
    participant API as Backend API
    participant DB as Supabase DB
    participant GA as Google Analytics

    U->>UI: Lands on page
    UI->>GA: Track page_view event
    UI->>3D: Initialize 3D mug scene
    UI->>Form: Render lead capture form
    3D->>3D: Load default mug model
    3D->>UI: Render interactive 3D scene
    Form->>UI: Display empty form fields

    Note over UI,Form: Both components visible simultaneously

    U->>3D: Rotates/explores mug
    3D->>GA: Track mug_rotate event
    3D->>Store: Update interaction state

    U->>UI: Selects color (blue)
    UI->>3D: Apply color to 3D model
    3D->>Store: Update design state
    3D->>GA: Track color_change event
    Store->>API: Auto-save design (debounced)
    API->>DB: Create/update design record

    U->>UI: Uploads image file
    UI->>API: POST /upload with image
    API->>DB: Store image metadata
    API->>3D: Return image URL
    3D->>3D: Apply texture to mug surface
    3D->>GA: Track image_upload event
    3D->>Store: Update design with image URL

    U->>UI: Adds custom text "Company Event"
    UI->>3D: Render text on 3D model
    3D->>Store: Update design with text
    3D->>GA: Track text_add event

    Note over U,Form: User fills form at their own pace

    U->>Form: Fills out contact fields
    Form->>GA: Track form_interaction events
    U->>Form: Submits form
    Form->>API: POST /api/leads with form data
    API->>DB: Create lead record
    API->>DB: Associate design with lead
    API->>GA: Track lead_capture conversion
    API->>Form: Return success + lead ID

    Form->>U: Show inline success message with next steps
```

**Key Difference from Previous Version:** The "High engagement detected ‚Üí Show lead capture modal" trigger step has been removed. The form is now always visible, and users engage at their own pace without automated triggers.

    alt Database connection fails
        DB->>API: Connection timeout
        API->>Monitor: Log error with context
        API->>UI: Return 500 with retry instructions
        UI->>U: Show "Please try again" message
        UI->>UI: Store form data locally
        
        Note over UI: Wait 2 seconds
        UI->>API: Retry POST /leads
        API->>DB: Retry database operation
        DB->>API: Success response
        API->>UI: Return created lead
        UI->>U: Show success message
        UI->>UI: Clear local storage
        
    else Validation error
        API->>API: Validate input data
        API->>UI: Return 400 with field errors
        UI->>U: Highlight invalid fields
